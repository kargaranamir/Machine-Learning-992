"This is bad..: It has every cliched ""gang"",""bad cop"",""LA"",""Rookie caught between his partner and whats right"" scene going. One of the worst films Ive ever seen - on a par with trashy alian/monster B movies from the 1970s. Why Denzel was nominated & got an Oscar for this is a mystery.Why Amazon recomended it for my wish list is another!!!!I gave it one star because LA has some good restaurants....",0
"It's his training day.: I saw this movie on tv once. My sister-in-law kept asking questions about it. Mostly my answer was just ""It's his training day"", as if repeating this helped answer the question of what was going on. I also speak louder to deaf people so they can hear me. The movie was bleh. Denzel Washington has one of the most symmetrical faces in Hollywood.",0
The most mundane cliched junk I've seen in a long time.: Training Day is mildly interesting in its previews and sets you up expecting a clever and scintillating day with a crooked cop. The only thing it truly succeeds at is pulling every cliche out of bad cop film history and throwing it out without even a scintilla of wit. The film is formulaic and very woman-hating from start to finish. Something more interesting to see would be Mamet's Heist.,0
(;D): The headline summarizes the movie! Denzel gets the Oscar for this one. Forget Russel Crowe and his Beautiful Mind. Ethan was so brilliantly subtle. Denzel u r the best! U made Popoye Doyle look like a wimp!i'm glad denzel got the oscar for traing day BUT i think he more deserve it for Malcom X,1
"Too much unbelievability: Denzel is a great actor, and I enjoyed the overall story, however there are way too many unbelievable scenes. Try running around LA pointing your gun at cars, people on the street, fighting in the street, and see how long it takes.",0
"What an awful movie: I thought with the Oscar award given to Denzel that this would be a great movie, with great acting. Boy was I disappointed, what a stinker. If this is indicative of how Oscars get selected, I guess garbage like this will win many more. Don't waste your time or money.",0
"Predictably Ridiculous!!: Even Denzel, a fine actor, after recieving his academy award said this film was ""..not his best work"" Definitely one for the 18 to 24 year old market because I certainly didn't like it.",0
"He did not deserve to win for this role: Although Russell Crowe is a talented actor I was really hoping Denzel would take home the Oscar that he deserved. After watching this movie, I was saddened that it was for such a horrible role. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Russell Crowe did have a lot of controversary around him at the time of the votes, his performance as John Nash was far superior to Denzel in this movie. I realize Denzel got the award more for his body of work however, it's really sad that they gave him the Oscar for such a poor role.",0
"Trash Day: I fortunately discipline myself to rent a DVD before purchasing one with few exceptions. This was a waste of money to rent, and I would not recommend purchasing the movie. It was typical trash, and if your'e into glorifying gangsters, drugs, slums, and bad cops, and generally, an ""anything for a buck"" movie--this may be of interest to you. Insofar as an academy award for best actor--it had to be a political pick as surely quality acting was not criteria for this winner.",0
"It's hard to believe...: ...that this film received anything other than a Turkey of the Year Award, much less the Oscar nominations. Between the offensive black stereotype portrayals, the blatant gaping plotholes, and the outrageously unrealistic action climax this was the worst film I saw in 2001. It's nice that Denzel got recognized for his rich acting career, but this wasn't the film to award and is ironic that it is his most one-dimensional stereotypical role.",0
"...: I rented this movie excited to see Denzel and his academy winning performance. Instead of being entertained, I was bored to tears. My husband only sat through half of the movie and he can tolerate anything!!! I forced myself to watch it to the end and though it was a complete waste of time. Yet, my sister watched the movie and loved it. Everybody has their own opinions, ...",0
"We read this book time and time again!: We read this book with our daughter when she was in pre-K and Kindergarten many, many times. Particularly enjoyable was that ""Mister Rogers"" went through some of the typical problems little kids have when they're just learning to form friendships and explained how they could be resolved in a soothing manner. I think it's a lot harder to grow up today than it used to be, and I'm glad Fred Rogers is there to help ease the way.",1
"LOVE this book: I LOVE this book. It gets its message clearly across in photographs of real kids & adults interacting, as well as in words. Highly recommended.",1
Life like photos: Very nice large photos. Yes they look a little dated but that does not take away from the charm of the book and the natural photos of the kids interacting as friends. Great addition to a pre-school classroom.,1
"great book for learning: Mr. Rogers works!I bought for my then 2yr old son as he started his preschool.He read it many times until he memorized the whole book, and used it.",1
excellent: I hope there are more of this type of books witten by this author it was great and the little twists and turns keep you interested until you read the last page,1
great indoor grill: Great for city dweller with no access to an outdoor grill and a small stovetop. The cast iron infuses food with smoky flavor and it's actually easier to clean than I thought.,1
"One of the dumbest books I've ever read.....: I don't like rating books with a 1 rating but it was a close decision with this one. This book was a waste of money and time and I only hope I can be convinced to read more VLT's books since this was my first.I hated all the euphemisms and how she made the female characters into such hicks. My family is originally from the south and even back in those days they didn't act or talk like these two women.I didn't like Gen or Jackson but did like the mother and Matt. One thing that bothered me about Annabelle though, was that she was 41 yrs. old but had thoughts like she was 80.",0
"Okay: I had high hopes for this book, but they were dashed within the first few paragraphs of this book. This book was just too unbelievable. From the sordid past of a girl from The Hollows in Tennessee to the stuck on a desert island with the computer programmer who turns out to be hot, the storyline was a bit too much. I admit that I did some skipping of pages here and there in order to get to the end to see what happened. I just had to know. :)",0
"Predictable: I thought I'd like this book because it sounded sexy, funny, imaginative. It was....in some parts of the book, but as a whole, it was predictable. The story line was cute, but the whole ""mom and boss"" romance was a let down. I gave this book two stars because some of it took me by surprise, but not much.",0
"Boring: What a waste of a day reading this. Made the people of Tenn look like ""nerds"". I like a good love story but this was just trash. Don't waste your time. No plot was so easy to see thru this just skimmed that last chapters.",0
"Awsome Book: its an exciting adventurous book, i couldn't keep my eyes off the book and it was an excellent storyline, even though it was too predictable it still kept me on the edge.",1
"Unreadable - Not trashy, just bad: I bought this book in hopes of a guilty pleasure. But the only one who's guilty is the writer -- of extremely bad writing. The whole thing reads like a painful freshman exercise in creative composition. The analogies are excruciating and the whole story is what comics would call ""hack."" Search for better trash elsewhere, perhaps an ""old-reliable"" like Jackie Collins or Judith Krantz.",0
"No morals, no brain: I love Vicki Lewis Thompson--have read most of her books and find her funny and her characters believable.But not in this book. I couldn't stand the heroine. As much as I tried to, I can't like a young woman who is out for sex with any man who shows up. She lost her virginity when she was 15 to a kid who promised he'd take her to the movie. She plans to have sex with her boss who she knows takes a different secretary to his weekend meeting to have sex with her--the idea that she plans to marry him doesn't excuse her. It makes her sound even dumber. Then she has the hots for the nerd in no time.I also disliked her showing people from Tennessee as ignorant idiots who talk funny and have several illigitimate children because the women can't say ""no"".Try something else by VLT--her other books are great.",0
"Sexy, fun read!: ""Nerd in Shining Armor"" by Vicki Lewis Thompson is a great book. This book has every thing:Great Characters, local to die for. This is the story of two people who would never think of hooking, but after crash landing on a desert island, they are forced to a second look at each other. A decide that they like what they see.Besides great main characters, Ms. Lewis-Thompson, gives the reader well developed secondary characters that work well in the story. Overall, this is a summer book that you don't want to miss!",1
"GOOD TITLE AND SYNOPSIS - STORY ITSELF A FLOP: I had every intention to enjoy this book. It had a great story idea-being stranded on a deserted island with a nerd. What a great opportunity for the author to work on conflicts, romance, and smoldering love scenes.Instead, the protagonist is a cheap hillbilly whore that musters up anything but sympathy. Perhaps the book would have improved if she were to become SHARK BAIT!The only redeeming character was the nerd, although he was a little too wimpy for my taste.The synopsis had fantastic potential - but a hard lesson was learned: You cannot judge a book by its cover!THE AUTHOR DROPPED THE BALL!I'll be honest. I never finished the book. It was THAT hard to swallow!I only recommend this book for future romance novelists. This book will teach you WHAT NOT TO DO!",0
"Tiresome and smarmy: I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read. It wasn't. It was tiresome ... to the point I just skimmed the last half. It was also smarmy as opposed to sexy. Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance novel. But this wasn't romantic. It was juvenile, almost painfully so, and the characters were complete idiots. Worse yet was the author's condescending attitude toward people from the state of Tennessee (for the record, I'm not from Tennessee but do have friends who live there). All I can say in closing is: Yuck!",0
"Problematic, but likeable: I had passed on this book a number of times before finally reading it, and I'll admit, I quite enjoyed it. It's a sexy, mindless beach read, and if you go into it with those expectations, I doubt you will be disappointed.Sure, there are problems. The heroine is at times condescending and unlikeable, and as another reviewer mentioned, the hero was too good for her. The writing is clunky and crude at times, and the plot chugs along clumsily.That said, I couldn't put it down. Sometimes there's room in your beach bag for a pointless and poorly-written fantasy, and this fits the bill.",1
"Let Down: I found myself discouraged several times with character development and found Gen's character rude/unlikable. Why would the sweet/honorable Jack (at times too weak) have such strong feelings for some rude woman? Additionally, I expected follow through in the love scenes. It is part of their foundation and discussed numerous times, but left the reader 'outside' the magic. I am a fan of Mrs. Thompson's work and will continue to buy her books; I just hope this is not an example of future works.",0
"WOW! Loved this sexy, sassy, very different book!: I love romances, all kinds, but it's so hard to find one that's really different. This one really is! The hero is this lovable, smart ""nerd"" who comes into his own when he's stranded with the girl of his dreams. Their hot, sensual relationship is wonderfully balanced by the secondary romance between the heroine's mother & boss (just loved that autumn romance!)I also really loved Gen's younger brother--what a great, true teenager.The humor was terrific--sharp and campy, at the same time. Loved the Elvis underwear story, loved the way Gen fell back on her mountain roots to help them survive on the island.Just loved it altogether!",1
"Decent premise, horribly written: I cannot believe this book has gotten good reviews. After slogging through over 200 pages, I absolutely couldn't take any more. The idea behind the book is actually pretty good (the back cover reads interestingly enough), but the book itself is truly terrible. The writing is stilted and the language crude. If I had read one more hillbilly euphemism I think I might have thrown up. Seriously, no one talks like that and it's insulting to Southerners that the author thinks so.Do not waste your money on this book. It will only encourage the author to write more literary trash like this.",0
total waste of time!: What a waste of time and energy. It took me forever to get through this book and I'm not ever finished with it. I don't think I'll ever finish it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I can't believe I wasted money on this! Save your money people..... I recommend you get yourself a cup of latte instead!,0
Nerd in Shining armor is so funny!: Let me just say that this is one of the most funny books that i have ever read! I would say this is a must read:) Plus it is on Kelly Ripa's book club. Her books are always the best if you like cute funny books!,1
Very Good Beach Read: Loved Gen and Jackson's interplay and getting to know each other. I didn't feel like it was rushed and you get to know the characters. Agree with some other reviewers that I wasn't too into the Elvis bits and some of the other things that the author did to try to get the reader to laugh. Enjoyed the plot and the sunny island atmosphere.,1
"Because I love Kelly Ripa...: I bought this book because I find Kelly Ripa so adorable, and she choose it for her book club. It was a book that was painful to finish...you know the type, you start skimming just to finish it. It was so silly and I hate when reading a book feels like a waste of time. It was really that bad.Just for the record, I really did want to like this book! The ""About the Author"" was the only funny page.",0
"Flunks as a Blue Cheer parody: First off, a version of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" dipped in molasses oozes from the speakers. But there's no Buck Dharma and the singer is _worse_ than Eric Bloom. Which takes some doing, lemme tell ya. Fu Manchu's ""Eatin' Dust"" almost makes it as a parody of Blue Cheer: raw and brutal guitar riffage steeped in Big Muff fuzz punctuated by a truly useless vocalist who can be counted on to interrupt the mood with bursts of tone-deaf and incomprehensible chatter that is passed off as chant-singing. On ""Mongoose"" and ""Pigeon Toe"" the drummer, bass player and one guitar player are allowed to develop a nice amount of head-bang without the singer wrecking things too much but by this time ""Eatin' Dust"" is almost over. Fu Manchu forgets the dirty little secret of heavy metal: No one who claims to like Blue Cheer actually listens to ""OutsideInside"" or ""Vincebus Eruptum,"" ever. Probably an awesome live band, though.",0
"ALL THAT I HOPED: The canvas velcro shoes were all that I had hoped.I had a full hip replacement on 1/3/06. Therefore, I needed something that was easy to put on and comfortable to wear. The canvas velcro shoes filled the bill.",1
"CASE for e100: Christmas present to go with the Sansa SanDisk e100. Doesn't cover the player face, but it has a belt clip so it offers some versatality over the plastic case that comes with the player. Shipped and received as promised.",1
"Many uses for this book.: Uses: Hide a burn on table, no one will move it, use when you run out of Sear catalog pages, burn to get a fire started, hit your spouse, and the main reason to build outdated storage that didn't even look good in the 50's. This book is a zero for ideas. What do I have to pay you to take my book? Not even the generous one star I gave it.",0
Do not buy!: I have had the wallet for less than a month and the spring clip is already too weak to hold bills properly!,0
Not what I was expecting: A lot bigger than expected. The clip doesn't hold the money very well and it's a mess fumbling with the money trying to get it in and out of the wallet. I gave it a try for a couple weeks but never came to liking it so I gave it away and bought another style.,0
Broke immediately: The clip at the center of this money clip stopped working correctly after about a week. This was a waste of money.,0
"Slim, elegant, and discreet.: Perfect for keeping in your front pocket. Slim and the leather appears to be of quality.",1
"defective money clip: I purchased this to replace a similar wallet as it had a couple of extra card slots.It has a movable money clip metal insert. The clip opens wide to insert money then supposedly clips shut to hold it.Mine would not stay closed.I hate the hassles involved in returning an item so I did not file a claim or report this to the seller.I super glued it shut. It is quite loose now unless it has a lot of bills in it, but at least it is not flying open.I definitely prefer the clips that are fixed and made of a spring type metal",0
"Money Clip: The cash clip wallet holds a good number of credit cards and other inportant information. However, the metal clip that is to hold your cash in place will not stay clamped down. It pops up and the cash bills are just loose. It is too risky to try using it. It may work fine if you have very few credit cards to carry but that is not the case with me. I have personal and business credit cards, insurance cards, AAA card, etc. The wallet just cannot handle that much. I was disappointed in the product. If it is going to have all these slots for cards, it ought to be able to handle a full load.",0
"Pretty good: It works, it's not cheap, and is leather. Not ""the solution"" to bulky wallets and money handling I was looking for, but something different that I'm happy to be trying out.",1
"Royce Leather Mens Money Clip Wallet With Two Outside Pockets: Looked at many wallets and glad I chose this one. It's made we'll, looks good, and just enough pockets. It looks so neat and my husband likes it!",1
"front pocket wallet with concealed money clip: I like this front pocket wallet with concealed money clip and room for credit cards versus the wallet I had that exposed everything.My ID is inside and my money and credit cards too. The money has a tentancy to slide out of the clip, but other than that, it is great.",1
"Attractive, good size.: For the last decade or so I've bought numerous wallets. I usually buy them specifically for the removable flip-out panel with ID window and credit card pockets. I don't like bulky wallets, but the plastic windows always tear, and when I carry cash (which I'm trying to do more now) I didn't have a place to hold it securely.This is the best of both worlds, and is attractive as well.The only complaints I have are that it's slightly larger than I was hoping (but still smaller than a bifold) and that it 'flares out' slightly at the edges. I'm hoping the latter will be fixed after I've sat on it long enough to break it in.Overall, I'm pleased.",1
"Great Wallet: Really clever design with the two pockets on the outside - I have my ID and my CC there and that's usually all I need. The metal clip thing that holds the bills is a bit weak though and pops up a bit too easily, but it's a slick looking wallet that doesn't tale up much space in your pocket. If I lost it I'd probably buy the same one again.",1
"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Not even worth renting.: --And not even worthy of one star (but Amazon forces you to choose a rating, so hence--my one-star feedback). Oy. What a disaster. Unless, of course, you're Ms. Aniston or Mr. Rudd who are laughing all the way to the bank with their this-script-beyond-sucks-but-holy-crap-you'll-pay-me-how-much paychecks. This lame piece of junk is just a bunch of tired cliches tied together with continuous punches of look-at-how-vulgar-we-can-be that is being marketed as ""clever."" I'm no prude, but this is not even good bad humor. It's just ... TOTAL BLAH. Bottom line: When will Hollywood figure out that even with dirty comedy, you still need to employ writers who can actually write. Otherwise, it's just dirty schlock.",0
"Stupidly hysterical!: This movie is wickedly funny! Is it kinda dumb? Yes. Will 20-somethings not ""get it""? Yes. But for anyone 50+ it will definitely give you ""flashbacks""! LOL!! (My 82-year old mother-in-law loved this movie!!) I admit I was surprised by the very brief but very graphic nudity, but can't imagine the film without it, as it is not what you think and is absolutely hysterical! Jennifer Aniston is perfect in this role, and Paul Judd gives a great performance as well. I could watch this again and again, it is so funny!",1
"Awful: It made me cry because I didn't want to keep watching it, but I felt I had to because I paid for it. Terrible acting, the plot was horrid and I feel like I got dumber from watching it.",0
"Not as good as I hoped.: However, it was okay. But it's one of those movies where stupid things just keep happening. Gets old after a while.",0
It's not that great: I thought this would be a great movie because Jennifer Aniston was in it. I also loved the title but the movie turned about to be weird. The character's character changed abruptly and it was difficult to tell if they were being sarcastic or if they really changed (for a few minutes).,0
Not impressed: I was hoping it was going to be a funny movie. A lot of people from The State were in it so I knew it was going to be funny. Not so much. It had moments. I love Paul Rudd and thought he could be the reason the movie would be great...he wasn't. I enjoyed watching the movie but probably won't watch it again.,0
"it had potential: It had a solid cast, a few jokes but overall I was rather disappointed in its drawn out storyline and failure to capture my attention. I think while watching it I kept checking Facebook to see if anything else was more entertaining than this movie.",0
"If not a Jennifer Anniston Fan then don't waste your time watching!!: The only reason I had to watch this Movie was because it stars my Favorite Lady of Hollywood, Jennifer Anniston, and I was also curious about her new Fiance, Justin Theroux, who is by the way a HUNK, and he also made the Movie really funny. It is a Corky, Screwball, Left Field Foul Ball of a Movie but it had its moments. If your a die hard Jennifer Anniston fan then yeah, you gotta see it, if not then don't waste your time. 2 StarsRobin, Athens, Georgia",0
"A cr*ppy movie: Only one word, awful. The only thing positive is that it shows just how screwed up the hippy movement was. I was in my teens when that experiment began and I was totally turned off.",0
"Gets better every time: Wanderlust was a surprisingly hilarious movie. I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I felt it was a decent movie...if anything. The difference with this movie(as is with several others...) is the more you watch it....THE FUNNIER IT GETS.I noticed a lot of movies lately become cult favorites...BECAUSE people watch it again and again. Paul Rudd is CLASSIC in this movie and Jen Anniston...though not as great as HORRIBLE BOSSES...still puts in a good performance. I purchased this movie only because I can't stop watching it! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes hilarious dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are forced into.",1
"Disappointment: Not worth the time. Good actors but that's about it - I expected more, especially after watching the funny preview. I stopped watching after a while....",0
"David Wain & Paul Rudd's Best Ever: If you don't have a sense of humor, don't bother watching this. If you are a David Wain and / or Paul Rudd fan, you will love this movie. It is hilarious with classic Wainisms and Rudd should win an Oscar for his performance. The writing will keep you laughing out loud and sure to inspire movie quotes with friends for years. The story isn't the greatest in the world and can be sappy at times but who cares, that is not what you are watching this movie for.",1
"Made me throw up: I am not a prude. I watch lots of slasher movies including the first 3 from the saw franchise so I am not overly squeamish. Wanderlust however made me so nauseous that I lost my cookies in a big way. They kept describing smells....and then when the main character started talking dirty to himself in the mirror I just lost it. Might just be me but I doubt it. In the outtakes he even said he was grossing himself out. Maybe if I hadn't spent time in a commune myself back in the 70's the descriptions of the smells wouldn't have come across so vividly for me, but I wouldn't watch it again. I am curious to know if anyone else reacted like I did.",0
"a few funny lines and scenes but overall a waste: This movie was predictable from the beginning, crude and just plain bad. I would never recommend this movie or watch it again.",0
"Horrible: That by far was the worse movie Jennifer every made. I watch the previews of Chelsea lately and they promoted it to be the funniest movie that year. Boy, were they wrong.",0
"Poor writing, forced dialog and not particularly clever: I couldn't even make it past the 30 minute mark before I shut this off. The characters were stereotypical and not well developed. Each character from the brother to the brother's wife, were one-dimensional. The plot could have been written by anyone and the dialog was (at least for the first 30 minutes) predictable and boring.I'm okay with crude jokes but they need to be clever for me to like them.There was nothing clever about this movie.",0
"Pretty smart for a dumb comedy: This was a lot of fun, and a lot wittier and more insightful than I had expected. Still a dumb comedy, just a lot smarter than most.",1
Painful: I was completely disappointed in this film. I consider myself a Paul Rudd fan but I find myself questioning his mindset when he chose to act in this movie. From start to finish the movie drags on and on. This is one of those movies where you just hope it ends as soon as possible. It really is that awful! You are warned!,0
Worst movie ever!!: This is the worst movie I have seen. I was about to throw the TV out the window. Dont waste your money on it. Wait until its on TNT!,0
No regular disc: The blue ray is fine but the regular DVD wasn't included. The whole reason I bought it was for both and I only got the one. Little disappointing.,0
"Usual Formulaic Crap: Rudd has no leading man qualities. Few actors can make you long for the talents of Ben Stiller, but Rudd is one of them. As a second lead, great. (40 yr old virgin, for example) But as a lead? no way. Aniston plays a post-collegiate 20-something who is trying to find herself. Of course, Aniston is 40+. And that's only the start of the ""R U Kidding Me"" stupidity of Wanderlust. This movie will be remembered as one of the increasingly annoying films from the shallow talent pool of Judd Aptow's stable of boy-men. A talent-less snooze fest.",0
"Must have been made by a bunch of teen boys.: Horrible movie, it appears to be made by a bunch of teen boys that have never been with a girl. It really sucks and would never show this movie to anyone that is under age. Would have expected more from this cast.Not good.",0
"Stunk: This was a really bad movie. We think Anniston made it so she could be with her boyfriend, but it wasn't funny at all and we wasted our money by renting it.",0
"Really, really bad.: I'll watch a silly movie every now and then.... this was unbearably bad. I just don't understand what Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd were thinking!",0
Is this what her career has become??: Couldn't even finish this movie it was so bad. It will be a long time before I try another Aniston movie.,0
"Bad to the bone!: This movie was bad to the bone. I can not believe how low some actors have gone for work. Not funny, not cute, nothing.......",0
Not for anyone under 18: This movie was so sexual graphic I would never recommend it to anyone. It was border soft porn. Horrible movie!,0
Dumb Film: The best part of this video is some of the outdoor scenes. The plot is rediculous and the acting is mediocre.I would not recommend it unless you like to see a naked man.,0
No good: I think it is stupid I have to write 18 words to rate a movie. I think the stars should be enough.,0
"Paul Rudd is Awesome!: I love Paul Rudd, but this is not one of his best movies. Very Very low budget and not a lot to keep your attention.",0
"skips the whole movie..: This dvd was in the 'used-very good' condition category, but it skips the whole movie. It skips in some of the best parts, too! Overall, horrible quality.",0
I honestly thought it was funny: I don't understand how everyone seemed to hate this movie. It was typical Paul Rudd. If you are a fan of his acting style and comedy you will like this movie. I really enjoyed it and have been wanting to see it again since I seen it in the theater.,1
"awful: I hated this movie. It seemed to have every cliche in the book. I expected it to be very funny, with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. It wasn't.",0
Not great: Too raunchy for my taste. Would not reccommend this movie. Still like Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd though - just not my cup of tea.,0
"Lame and unfunny: There were some great characters in here but either the actors, script writers, or the director couldn't bring it together to make it funny and entertaining.",0
"WANDERSUCK: You know with a name like Wanderlust & with a star like Jen Anniston in it, I really had high hopes for this movie, like maybe seeing Jen half naked or something. Well if you're wondering & have yet to see this bomb, wonder no more because there is absolutely no female nudity in this movie at all. Plenty of male nudity though, full frontal & everything confirming that the story was written by a female or male who likes other males. Lame storyline, felt more like a movie that was just thrown together in someone's backyard. If it didn't have the stars in it that it has, it have gone straight to b-movie status in the discount area of the video store. I'm disappointed that Jen would include herself in such a horrible flick, didn't even finish watching it. Avoid this one like the plague...",0
Wanderlust: This movie was a waste of some really great acting talent. Not funny or entertaining at all! I wish I had never purchased!,0
"previews are better then the movie: Remember when you first saw the preview for the movie and you thought, ""this is going to be hilarious!"" Well, you were wrong...and don't feel bad, so was I. Thankfully, I had a coupon for this movie and it didn't cost me a penny. Don't waist your time...it really sucked. It wasn't funny, and it was predictible. If you are looking for an excuse to waist two hours and not get them back..this is the movie for you. And shame on you Jennifer Aniston...I thought you had better taste then to do a movie like this. I guess the $$ was too good to pass up.",0
A waste of an evening: Interesting concept with potential. Unfortunately it didn't go far or deep enough and didn't really have the substance for either a social commentary or even a comedy. The acting was OK but I wish I could have used my evening watching a better movie. Hot Tub Time Machine is much better because it was a comedy that stayed a comedy and didn't attempt a deeper meaning.,0
"Not great: This movie doesn't have much going for it beyond the great cast. I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but this movie just plodded along. The jokes were contrived and there was nothing really driving the plot forward. A lot of the characters were pretty horrible. There's a long scene where Paul Rudd is saying foul things into a mirror that just went on forever, and was not funny. I'd skip this one unless you are a die hard fan.",0
"A Bad Movie: If it wasn't for some boobage (tons of old lady boobage, tho.), I would have given this movie only one star. A really bad movie and the Jennifer Aniston character is pretty weak.",0
"Wanderlust: Wanderlust is a light comedy that requires no thinking on the viewers part. The characters are interesting to say the least. Overall an ok movie. Would I buy it, no. Would I rent it for a couple of bucks to kill a Saturday night, yes. In an age of reality television this is a much better alternative.",1
"Super funny movie: I thought this movie was so funny, it had me laughing to tears multiple times. Definitely not for the prudish type, though, as there is plenty of dirty talk and nudity. I love Paul Rudd's style of comedy and Jennifer Aniston plays on it perfectly. I will absolutely recommend this movie!",1
Wanderlust: It was pretty good...a little slow at times somewhat raunchy at others. Overall I would recommend the movie to adults.,1
"Peace, love & vomit: Theme-Urban YUPPIES get fired find peace in country retreat with society's castoffs-yawn! I thought they stopped making movies like this?",0
"A 40 minute movie: I think there is exactly 40 minutes of decent film here, the rest looks like they were literally making it up as they went along. You can tell that some scenes were being improvised on the spot and they made the final cut, which tells you something... Like I said, there is 40 minutes of good stuff here, funny stuff, but the rest of the sheeyit that was interspersed into the film made it hard to watch. Literally. There were some scenes where my friends and I were asking each other ""what the eff is going on here? I can't stand this anymore, can I fast forward past this to the next scene?"" extremely disappointing, especially when considering the talent that was cast. Oh well, at least I didn't waste $12 in the theatres on this dreck.",0
"Pretty good...: This movie was pretty funny, but not entirely original or surprising. Justin Theroux was the best part. All of the performances are solid, but his stood out. Paul Rudd and Jennifer Amiston were Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but that isn't really a knock. The movie was entertaining and worth watching.",1
so uncomfortably funny!: This movie was a 5 star sleeper! We can't get enough of it. We keep watching it over and over again because there are so many funny lines! Fantastic movie!!!,1
Hilarious: Easily one of the funniest paul rudd movies ive seen. This had me laughing from start to finish which is hard to do nowadays for me anyways. Jennifer aniston is great in this movie and this is by far paul rudds best performance. You might find his mirror scene annoying the first time but it only gets funnier every time you rewatch this movie. Also the unrated edition is on the special features and is 18 minutes shorter....its more of a blooper version i think...its not as funny but its funny to watch if that makes any sense....dont watch the unrated version before the standard.,1
"Not that impressed: Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but this storyline struck me more as cognizant infidelity than curious exploration. Aniston's character abandons her inhibitions in record time and is suddenly deaf, dumb, and blind to her husband's feelings. The story felt forced and as a result, lost much in the way of humor.",0
"Not so great: This is one of those movies that seems like a great idea on paper, but mostly winds up making predictable and easy jokes. It leans on so many things we've seen before that it just left a bland taste in my mouth. It's nothing personal, as all the actors involved are mostly top notch, there's just no meat on this bone.",0
"Funny in some parts: Glad I didn't pay a whole lot to watch this movie, it was funny in parts but didn't really enjoy it overall",0
"They owe me stars! Movie is horrible. Absolute garbage.: I hate to even give this one star.This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.. Tried to watch, but had to stop after 15 minutes. Thought Paul Rudd, Jennifer Aniston I like them both, need some light laughs. Boy was I wrong. Crude, stupid ""humor"". Paul & Jennifer should be ashamed to be part of this horrible piece of trash.If you truly want to waste your money and your time watch this movie. You will be sorry you did. Absolute garbage.",0
"Wanderlust JMHO: It would be hard to get me to say anything bad about this movie. It's not for kids, that's for sure. It's a mature, silly comedy (silly in the best ways). There are several of my favorite actors in it, Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, Alan Alda and they all do a great job! Paul Rudd is hilarious and I was lmao at him in more than one scene-he plays the awkward, at times bumbling husband perfectly. It's a funny movie and I recommend it and also recommend watching through the bloopers and outtakes as they're hilarious as well.",1
"Seriously unfunny: A great cast can't save this stinker. Tired plot, tired jokes. Got it as a bargain rental and still contemplated asking for a refund. Just not funny.",0
don't bother: mildly amuzing-that is all there is to say-acting-probably one of Jennifer's worst-she must have needed a paycheck-was fun to see Alan Alda,0
"Disappointment: As much as I like Jennifer Aniston, this is a very bad movie.In order to fully appreciate how bad this movie really is, one has to watch it till the very end. At first, it seems that the wife of the couple is the stupid one, while the husband is just tired and unlucky. But at the end it gets clear that both are complete idiots (and that is why they are married).There are only few funny jokes. Most of them are captured in the trailer for this movie.If you are still curious, watch it, but do not spend too much money. I spent around 20 dollars on DVD. It does not worth it.",0
"another bad movie: The acting is terrible. Can Jennifer Aniston ever play a role of some quality?This movie had weak characters and a weak story.Will the day ever return when we no longer have the need to show male and female genitals in order to sell tickets.I could go on forever, but please do not rent or buy this movie.",0
"Very Disappointing...: This movie, for me, had so much potential. Paul Rudd is an incredible comedic actor, and I had high hopes for Justin Theroux. Jennifer Aniston, in every role since Friends, plays the ""Rachel""- like character and frankly it is getting old. This movie is simply not funny.",0
"Disappointing and cynical: I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked pretty funny. I'm a big Paul Rudd fan. He was actually really great in this movie, but the story line SUCKED. It had a bazar cadence, with disheveled emotions. The end is especially stupid. What turned me off the most, is how this movie played on the stereo type that all earth friendly, hippy types who live an alternat life style, are in a cult. The leader of the commune in this movie is an egotistical jerk - right from the beginning. This is just such a main stream, cynical view of free thinking, spiritual, alternative, vegan, type of people. This movie just leaves a bad taste in you're mouth. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star, was that Paul Rudd and Jenifer Aniston were really good.",0
"Eh . . .: Raunchy, vulgar, disgusting, and not all that funny. I like Jennifer Aniston (usually), but this one was not so great.",0
"bad boring rank and a complete waste of time: I don't know how anyone can say this was a good movie. I found it rank, STUPID, boring, lousy acting, lousy plot, not entertaining, and a waste. If it didn't star Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston then it wouldn't draw ANY viewing.",0
easy going & funny!: easy going & funny! not the best or funniest movie but still i didn't feel like i wasted my time after watching it.,1
Wanderlust not a bust: Wanderlust is a timely release. Many people are dealing with the slower economy and making changes in their life styles. The story line is plausible and the characters are fun.,1
"Paul Rudd in top shape!: This movie is great from start to finish. Paul Rudd delivers another awesome comedy. Rudd and Aniston really seem to play off each other very well, and this is probably the best movie Jennifer has been apart of in a long time.The laughs are non stop, and some of the are pretty raunchy, so be forewarned, it has a R rating for a good reason and it earns every bit of it. The characters are just so off the wall, that each one brings their own comedic style, and they are all hilarious and work so great together.Check this one out for sure, you are guaranteed to laugh your ass off, I sure know I did.",1
Nope: This movie went from worst to just plain bad. Even with named actors they could not carry this movie as it needed to be.,0
Dissappointed: I must say not one Jennifer Anistons best and I consider Myself a great fan.The Teaser Trailer was much Funnier than the movie as a whole..,0
delightful entertainment: I really enjoyed this funny movie. I have watched it at least 4 times now and enjoyed it each and every time,1
"Pure David Wain: I loved this movie. I wasn't prepared to, I adore Wainy Days and anything whereDavid Wain is having fun and being silly. Unfortunately, many of his recent movies feel like they are taking them self too seriously, like the laughter has been stifled. But THIS! This had the same fun, weird, sweet vibe that Wet Hot American Summer had. Wanderlust turned out to be a refreshing, goofy, fun time.",1
"Great: Great movie, the packageing was great, the dvd was not scratched. Watched it all the way through without any problems",1
"Used - Like New?!?: First, there's a sticker on the front that says ""DVD Now Kiosks"" Insert This Way, clearly indicating this DVD was stolen from a DVD machine. Strike one.Besides the fact that there's no security tape on here, being that it's stolen, there's simply nothing ""like new"" about this. The top of the dvd has finger smudges, crumb-like particles, and unidentifiable crud. Strike two.If I could get past the apparently thievery of this dvd, I might be okay with it, if the dvd had at least looked like it was cleaned once. Didn't happen. Strike three.This product and purchase deserves a giant FAIL.Can't wait to re-gift this...not.",0
"Paul Rudd Hurts My Brain: This movie was painful to watch. It actually wasn't so horrible until a little bit in. For once someone in a Jennifer Aniston movie was more annoying than her character. Paul Rudd was horrible. In one scene he's talking to himself in the mirror to pump himself up for sex and saying things like, ""I'm gonna get all up in that vag."" And then he repeats this and the like for what feels like forever in some of the dumbest voices I've ever heard. Not funny at all. I'm hard to offend but this was just BAD. It would be insanely uncomfortable to watch this with any older members of my family. God, it was uncomfortable just watching this alone. Would any woman sleep with this man? The fact that two women in this movie wanted to seemed insane and just wishful thinking on the part of whatever idiots wrote this script. I kept praying some wild animal would eat Paul Rudd during this scene just so he would shut up.",0
"We loved it...: This movie was light hearted and fun. If you are looking for a good movie to kick back and enjoy some time with a loved one or friend, it's a good one. We laughed and enjoyed this movie for what it was, fun.",1
"Horrible, Tasteless Movie: I was so disappointed in this movie. We never would have pegged 2 stars like Aniston and Rudd would be in such a low class, B type movie. At one point Rudd has a scene where he is talking into a mirror, he goes on and on and on and on, it is painful watch. So distasteful. Don't waste your time or money.",0
"Awful, awful, awful: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Did I watch it to the end? Well yes, I like my endings, but I fast fowarded it through about 20 minutes. It's not that it was too vulgar or that I am a prude. It is just a really bad movie. I like the actors, just not this movie.",0
"two stars for the trailer: This movie started out good but somewhere in the middle it just lost steam and got boring. They tried to wrap in a flimsy plot but it just fell flat. I dont even think it was really all that crude or vulgar just not funny. I do not recommend it, the trailer has all the good parts in it. I wish i could get a time refund.",0
Wanderlust: The Wanderlust- movie Would not recommend this to anyone. It was vulgar and really not something I would want to see again.,0
"Disappointing: While there are some extremely funny scenes, there's a lot of content that's just so horribly put together. If you do choose to view this, fast-forward through the scene where George starts talking to himself in the bathroom mirror. It's a never-ending scene of him saying things like ""I'm gonna f*** the s*** out of you"", ""I'm gonna f*** you"" and ON AND ON in different STUPID voices. (It's not the language, it's the STUPID voices that I hated.)I think that was just the most painful scene of all,as it was just BEYOND horribly awful, and went on forever. Who writes crap like this?The movie is very disjointed- the ""plot"" doesn't have a good flow. Some parts were very entertaining, most of it was really weird (but who'd expect anything other than weird with a plot centered around a hippie like commune?)- and a LOT of the weird was REALLY LAME.I wish we'd have gone with a different movie.",0
tired story: Amazon.com Gift Cards - In a Gift Box - Free One-Day ShippingNot very original about hippies in a commune without the sixty's music. My Grandpa might like it. How about something more up to date?,0
"Really bad script: Ok so I love Jennifer Aniston's work. Almost all of her movies have been enjoyable so I am really surprised that I didn't like this one, at all. Whom ever wrote the script for this movie knew what potentially could be funny but couldn't execute. American Pie, hilarious and just as ronchy but it was executed well. This movie just left you staring at the screen going...wow...how much longer is this? I paid $16- for this??? It's a shame because I was looking for one redeeming quality about this movie, for instance, one liners that are funny...like 'this one time, at band camp':) I was shocked that there wasn't even that. Really sad that is movie was so poorly scripted and directed. Spend your money elsewhere...sorry Jen. Also received Monty Python's search for the holy grail...now that is timeless comedy. Will be watching that tonight trying to erase the sorry mess this movie was.",0
"awful: Unless you like foul language, a bad plot, and other unpleasant things, you might want to avoid this movie. I love Alan Alda, but this was a bomb. I had mute most of the movie because it was disgusting. Stopped it finally when I couldn't take any more.",0
wanderlus: not much to say about the movie not happy with the video download from amazon. I will not ever rent a movie from this format again,0
"Plain, unpure, awful.....: I took a chance watching this movie starring Jennifer and Justin who appear to have an admirable off screen relationship. What a disappointment. I agree with all the 1-star ratings. These reviewers hit the nail on the head. The first thing that came to mind was ""B"" movie with a scholastic grade of D- for rotten storyline mixed with trashy dialogue. The best thing that came out of this movie must have been real life proposal. Maybe Justin will write a quality script and he and Jennifer can produce another movie to make up for this awful one as in: it only gets better from here.",0
"Wander away from this movie.: Ir's bad enough that you'll want your 90 minutes back after watching this waste of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston's talent (assuming you keep watching after the 'mirror scene'), don't make it worse by spending actual money on it. Wait for cable if you must.",0
"Much Better Than Expected: After much protest, I watched Wanderlust. Jennifer Aniston is the kiss of death to many of the movies she has been in. This time around, she doesn't do too bad.Director David Wain, Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast of new-age hippies keep this comedy moving along. It can be sweet,inspiring, and extremely uncomfortable all in about 5 minutes. While there isn't anything new offered with Wanderlust, there are plenty of laughs. It's well worth a watch.If you are a fan of The State, Stella or Wainy Days, this movie is going to be right up your alley.",1
"Funny date night flick!: Great date night flick. My wife and I rented it while having dinner in bed, and we really enjoyed it! Gave it 4 stars because it got a little slow in a few spots, but overall we really liked it!",1
"zzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: Kubrick's second feature is a noir nadir: one ugly, awkward, somniferous crime (void of) drama in the vein of a octogenarian's home come Thanksgiving. Highlights of my lifespan's longest hour include rigid, insipid performances, slapdash editing and a narrative surfeited of immaterial, supererogatory exposition that far exceeds (and inevitably eclipses) a lean and shopworn plot. Only a penultimate scene proves distinctive for its fight sequence, ineptly executed by the standards of exploitation fare. Kubrick's dissatisfaction with his antecedent debut Fear and Desire prompted him to withdraw it from public screenings; had he done likewise with this supreme exercise in tedium, no one save completist enthusiasts of American cinema's most autocratic auteur might vocalize misgivings in concern of its inaccessibility by curtailment.This picture's theatrical tagline reads: ""Her Soft Mouth Was the Road to Sin-Smeared Violence!"" Yuck!",0
"killer's kiss: what s stinkeri guess every director has to start somewhereand i guess this was STANLEY KUBRICKS starterwhich was the only reason i bought iti now have all of his films in my collectionbut let's be brutally honest here it stnckwith a capital ""S""i will say i'm gladmr kubrick seemed to haved llearnedfrom his no plot crappy or dare i say itok i will no story what soeverok the only thing about the moviethat resembled a story was the endingwhen the killer ""kissed"" hisgirlfreindi guess thats where the title comes from",0
"The kind of film I would have made if only I had the time: Stanley Kubrick's extreme talents finally explode onto the big screen with this remarkable little film about a boxer who saves a young woman from her boss who tries to rape her, he soon falls in love with her and the boss gets incredibly jealous. The plot is not that good at all but thanks to Kubrick, there's plenty of great lighting, suspence and best of all a stupendous fight scene with the arms and legs of dummies. Film go's on for only 68 mins which makes it easy to sit through. See it.",1
"Definitely an early sign of what was to come.: First off, a quote from an earlier reviewer: ""Poor Stanley. He got stuck with a pretty lame script for this one."" Funny. You see--and I'm not making this up--KUBRICK WROTE THE SCREENPLAY!!! Moving on. This was an enjoyable, if flawed, film, with some great scenes . . . and some real duds. The direction is great (obviously), and the acting is, even at its worst, passable, but the story is lacking in inspiration. Still, pretty damn good for a director's second feature-length film.",1
Kubrick fan: this movie didn't really provide a good story line or plot....I was very disappointed with it. No surprises here I was expecting more,0
A great CD about crime back in the 1950's.: An interesting movie about crime back in the sixties and the actors in the movie do very well with the script.,1
"Wonderful music: I heard this music at a recent concert and remembered it fondly from music classes at college. First thing on getting home I ordered from Amazon and was very pleased with the service. Ravel was a most interesting composer. The Mother Goose Suite is my favorite with it's beauty and whimsey and almost heavenly final piece. There were many choices as to orchestras, and I'm pleased with the Berlin Radio Symphony orchestra rendition I chose.",1
"windshield cover: It works great to keep frost, ice, and/or snow off the windshield. It is easy to use and covers the windshield completely. The only thing that could be improved is the suction cups; they don't stick to the inside of the windshield when it is cold.",1
"Keeps the Snow and Ice Off!: Well worth the money. This product works just great. I have used it a few times and it does exactly what it promises. I have a mid-size SUV and it covers the windshield with plenty of material to spare. My guess it would have no problem covering a full size SUV window.I do recommend that you secure the bottom with your wiper blades. It seems like it could have a tendency to get whipped around if it was really windy out. It was a bit of a challenge fighting the wind trying to get this on. But once you know the wind direction, just secure the up-wind side onto your windshield with the wiper blade and inside the car door and it becomes much easier.",1
"Worth the money: For the price, this product works pretty well to keep the snow and ice off your windshield. The downsides are that it is pretty large (and easier to put on with 2 people), seems subject to tearing, and you have to remember to actually put it on! But it is serving the purpose so far!",1
"Not Jumbo: This was supposed to be a ""jumbo"" sized windshield cover, intended to cover up larger van windows. The picture even shows a woman putting the cover on her van window. When we got it, we tried it on the van and it did not cover any more than the standard windshield cover we already had. Comparing the size to our standard cover, it was a hair larger, but it still did not cover the entire windshield as described. Also the quality was poor. I could have just bought a piece of plastic tarp and cut it to fit the windshield and I would have had something better. I returned it to Amazon.",0
"Jumbo is a joke: Jumbo to me means that it should fit on a Lumina Van windshield nicely but it doesn't. It would be a great product if it were bigger. First of all when on the Lumina APV windshield, there is about 4 to 6 inches on the top and the bottom that doesn't even get covered. And for the length...it's not even long enough to suction cup to the inside of the windshield. I have to just put one end in the door and shut it and pull the other end and try to tighten the slack out of it and shut the door without smashing my fingers. It works where it is covered though. The suction cups that come with it stink. They don't work when cold, so just go to walmart and buy the medium sized suction cups with hook (3 to a pack) and remove the hooks and put those on. They work much better.",0
"Good Information Though an older book: The cover on the book that I have is much different than the one pictured. The one I have is dated 1995, so it is much older, but still has very valuable information in it though some of it is outdated to say the least. I don't know if an updated version would have more up to date statistics in it, but the nutritional information presented is still quite valid.",1
"pretty, comfortable, and low maintenance: These are very pretty lace, but they stay put, and really are one size fits most. I throw them in the gentle wash and low temp dry, heck with the hand washing business. These are convenient, I would buy them again.",1
"One Size Does NOT Fit ""All""...: I have loved my HP's in the past. I had numerous pairs and wore them often. I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great. I am 5'5"" and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy...ugh, what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back...why in the world they don't offer sizes is beyond me...",0
Absolutely Love these Thongs: It is like these thongs are not even made of material at all...invisible to touch...great underneath clothing and very easy to care for - DO NOT DRY!!!,1
best thong ever!: originally got hooked on this because of an article i read in the wall street journal claiming that the two women who started this company were revolutionizing thong panties... and boy did they! by far the most comfortable thong ever! they sit low on hips and come in every color imaginable!!,1
"Love these, so comfy: Feel like they are arely there. So comfy, I will be buying more. I can even wear through my pregnancy",1
"LOVE MY HANKY PANKY!!: Have been wearing thong panties forever but was getting ready to change to boy shorts because I couldn't find a comfortable thong. Read about these panties on Yahoo News, checked out the reviews on Amazon, ordered 2 pairs and LOVE THEM!! They really are the most comfortable panties ever and so well made!! They are a little expensive, but for some things, you really do get what you pay for!!! I want a comfortable thong panty and have no problem paying $20/pair for just that!!! I LOVE THESE PANTIES and am going to order more.",1
"Imperanon: Here we have Imperanon's, first full-length album, Stained. Imperanon is a melodic-death metal band from Finland. They have a standard, run-of-the-mill Finnish sound, but add in a neo-classical twist; much like Children of Bodom's older releases. The guitar riffing is very noodlely and power metal-esque. Fast pace solos and well thought out melodies. The vocals are much like Petri Lindroos', as a matter of fact, the singer from Imperanon just replaced Petri in Norther. There are also a couple of guest appearances from which add to the power metal sound. The Keyboards are also well heard and stand out, and there is a lot of variation with them as well. The rhythm section is spot on melodic death metal at its finest. It is a worthy release and if your into COB or Finnish metal, neo-classical, and anything with virtuoso playing i would defiantly recommend this album.",1
"awesome: this cd is awesome. Imperanon are yet another badass band to come out of Finland. Their sound is very similiar to Children of Bodom, Kalmah, and Norther. If you like those bands, you'll like them. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1
Must have item for Windows 95 users: This was a delight to use and as a bonus you can recharge the pda while doing hot sync operations. Very well made. You will not be disappointed.,1
Great live versions of tunes from my favorite solo album: I really feel like 'The Old Kit Bag' is perhaps RT strongest solo album in the last 10 years. Most of the tracks on Ducknapped are live versions of songs from that album and they are excellent. I really like the tune 'Bank Vault in Heaven' it has some tremendous guitar solos that are worth the price of the album.,1
"not what is pictured: I didn't mind what I received. It was a wooden letter. I just don't know why a different ornament is pictured. I wanted to return them since I bought a bunch for my daughter and other relatives for Christmas but it was less than 2 dollars, i figured what the heck. Put the right picture of the product you are selling please!",0
"A TRULY AWSOME EPIC.: This has to be one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard.The Beatles have been reinvented, and someone listening to the Beatles for the first time ever or for longtime fans will talk about this album for decades.I am also one who would like to see the entire Beatles library redone by the Martins.YOU MUST GET THIS CD. I also want to go to Las Vegas to see the show!",1
"Mix Master: I bought this album because I saw the show in Vegas. Though not a Beatles fanatic, I have always appreciated their music. However, the show and this album do make you recognize thier musical genius. By blending tracks from their earliest pieces to those of their later works, you can see how they created a body of work that has never been rivaled. They transitioned from genre to genre as their music evolved from simple pop and rock and roll to more complex lyrics with social messages and mealodies that incorporated tones from around the globe. While other compilations tend to walk you through time and memories, this album pushes you listen to the Beatles work in a whole new way.",1
"Fabulous: I just finished listening to it for the first time in the car on the way to work. I was blown away by the how fresh and new the songs are and yet retain all of there original luster. Amazing job done by the Martin father and son team. Face it who else could take the most important and influential music of my generation and move it to another level. I was concerned from reading some of the reviews and articles that this may adulterate the music that provided me with 40 years of enjoyment. Not so, BUY THIS CD! Not just another repackaging of the same songs. Should be a stocking stuffer for every baby boomer.",1
"eerie and wonderful: This album brings the Beatles back to old fans and new listeners in very unexpected ways. The remixed music is rich and nuanced; the juxtaposed pieces are effective and moving. ""Love"" has given my household great pleasure, but also the eerie sense of John's and George's living presence.",1
"diggin it: got this for my Mom, sister-in-law and myself ......... we're all enjoying it. Can't get much better then the Beatles and love!",1
"It's a Soundtrack, Stupid: I bought this CD/DVD-A for something to play in my new car's 5.1 Surround Sound system. It lives up to all expectations: entertaining, high quality sound, and it beats the demo DVD-A that came with the car.This is not a ""best of"" Beatles music; it's a soundtrack of Cirque du Soleil's ""Love""...a show (at the Mirage, Las Vegas) built around a montage of Beatles songs. There aren't many early Beatles songs here; they don't fit the Cirque format (if you've ever seen a Cirque de Solei show, you know what I mean) or the 5.1 format (many were recorded in mono).I haven't listened to the stereo CD version since I bought it specifically for the 5.1 format. But based on its content, I wouldn't recommend this CD/DVD-A except for the novelty of the 5.1 playback or for someone who wants to relive the show itself.And, finally, buy the mono box set if you are just looking for Beatles music!",1
"Great remix of Beatles music.: I'm a huge Beatles fan (as my screen name suggests!), and I refused to listen to this CD until now. I'm a purist when it comes to the Beatles -- no covers, no remixes, no muzak arrangements, no alt-rock interpretations, thankyouverymuch. Just the originals. But my curiosity finally got the best of me, so I ordered a copy (truth be told, I just wanted to bring my order amount up to the free shipping minimum), and now I regret I didn't buy this sooner. George and Giles Martin have done a fantastic job remixing these Beatles classics. There are some really interesting pairings -- pieces of ""Drive My Car"" coupled with ""The Word?"" And it works -- beautifully. It will never take the place of the originals for me -- I don't think George Martin intended it to -- but for me, it was almost like hearing the music again -- for the first time. I love this CD.",1
"Great Re-mix!: Sonically the album was great, was amazing to hear songs of my youth sounding so different but still fresh with Beatles energy. Even the new cuts were great given two of the band members have passed away. This music will never get old and future generations are feeling the same as we did originally in the 60's. My Son loves this music and shares the same joy I do when we listen together.",1
"""LOVE"" ain't all we need....: This is really just a one-listen curio dolled-up as ""Beatles Lite: For Lovers"", aimed squarley at The SoccerMom and DiaperDad set. What Sir George needs to do NOW, however, is stop the AdultContempo naval-gazing (nothin' but lint, pal), and drop dem straight remasters of the Beatles Canon, poste-haste. Dig?",0
Stars on 45?: By all means try to get the best quality out of these recordings but why mix two or more songs together into a pointless medly.This is only slightly better than Stars on 45.,0
"beatles fans stay away: I was excited for this album a little skeptical but excited the las vegas show is a great idea. The music would be great in the show, not so much to listen too. Most of the songs could be made by a 10 year old slowing and speeding up the tracks on a computer and adding a guitar riff here and there. The song titles are not telling the truth for example blackbird/yesterday, i thought that could be cool, my kids love the black bird song, 6 seconds of the guitar from blackbird than yesterday starts. There is not 26 songs here some are just plain noise with a 10 second guitar riff. If you do not like the beatles alot or are heavily into acid and shrooms this might be a good buy for you.",0
Beatle Fan: This is a wonderful remaster of the Beatles recordings. This is the same soundtrack used at the Cir De Solei Show at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. We were surprised with a live stage show of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. Great show and great music.,1
The Best Of The Beatles: This is the best Beatles Music i have heard.The Audio is fantastic and the music selection is awesome!!!Every Beatles fan should hear this great song fest.Buy this album NOW!!!!,1
"At least the better new Beatles release: I cringe with fear the so-called new Beatles releases that pour out every Xmas. Anthology was a mix match of gems and also rejected stuff. The BBC anthology was so so. Like Elvis, the Beatles is the most recycled group ever.I like this one. Although there is technically nothing new hear, the remixes give the Beatles, a fresh new Moulin Rogue sound. The recordings sound fresh and not old.If Elvis can be remixed for the dance floor, some clever guy at EMI should do it. Allons-y!",1
"The Beatles LOVE CD: A fellow Beatles fan told me about this disc. I thought it was just another compilation of previously released material, but it's a whole lot more than that! It's a joining together of the Beatles songs and musical passages into a unique theatrical-type program which is extremely enjoyable in its concept and also sounds cleaner with better fidelity. I suspect some first generation master tapes were utilized. If you love the Beatles, you'll probably flip over this baby! If you're not sure if you love the Beatles, this well-produced and conceived CD will convert you completely. George Martin did a wonderful job and I'll bet it was a labor of love....The Beatles LOVE rules!",1
"the point??: Being an avid Beatles listener, I was curious about what this would sound like when it came out. Let's just say that the version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is nice. Other than that, I see nothing unique about Love other than a haphazard combination of random songs and studio [...]. Can anyone explain the actual point of this album??",0
Terrific: A little bit of everything. More than a greatest hits Cd. The transisitions between songs are edgy. This is pure Beatles with a modern spin.,1
"Beatles Extravaganza: Simply stated, this album is remarkable. As the liner notes attest, the sound reflects the extraordinary talent of a ""young band"" that merely changed the world. With an articulate and masterful touch from George and Giles Martin, the mixing of so many outstanding Beatles songs into such a cohesive ""set"" leads you to believe you are listening to a magnificent new body of work from the group. A fresh and amazing approach to songs that have filled my life for the past 40 plus years.",1
"Don't believe the hype.: This CD is not the fantastic, crazy mash-up we've all been waiting for. I eagerly picked this up, thinking somebody had done something weird and wonderful with all those classic tunes, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in probably half the songs. Sure, maybe some lyrics are slightly different, maybe the music has been moved around, but most of these tracks could be outtakes from the original sessions. Either the mixer isn't all that creative or they just didn't take the time.There's a brilliant mash-up Beatles CD lurking somewhere in the future. This, unfortunately, isn't it.",0
"Love - The Beatles: One man's opinion, so please take it as such. I grew up with the Beatles, and as a avid fan of the Beatles I can appreciate their music in almost any format, however . . . If you appreciate the genius and artisty of the Beatles, and can never seem to get enough, get yourself the real thing in its original form. If you appreciate show tunes, get yourself show tunes. Love is a mixture of both, and in my opinion fails at both. I never thought I'd think it, let alone express it, but this is a blatant attempt to exploit Beatle music in order to make a few more bucks. As a collection of bits and pieces of Beatles music that was perfect in the original, but remixed here to give it a new look, it fails miserably. Do what you want, but given a second chance, I would avoid it.",0
"I didn't LOVE this album: I'm sure the idea of having George Martin and his son Giles re-mix the Beatles's songs must have sounded very appealing to the remaining Beatles, their wives and the record company. However, this idea never lives up to its promise. The transition mixes are a jumble of sounds that scramble one style period to the next. The ""Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You/Helter Skelter"" stands out as especially bad. The acoustic version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" starts as a potential highlight of the album, only to be ruined by the weepy string arrangement of George Martin, who said he was apprehensive about doing it. The Beatles songs are great, but there is no flow in this album and the transitions and selections from one song to the next are jarring. I liked the music but did not LOVE this album.",0
"Great Compilation: This is a great compilation if you are looking for a little bit of everything from the Beatles. A huge Beatles fan friend of mine recommended it to me, and I'm really glad I purchased it. A good mixture from the beginning of their career through the end with a nice mix of upbeat and more mellow tunes. Highly recommended.",1
"Great CD with cool new versions: When I saw the CD it stated that there were new remixed versions by George Martin. That was enough to make me bite and purchase the CD brand new which is something I never do.I really enjoyed it. Several songs didn't sound like there were many changes to them - perhaps there weren't. However the song that were ""combined"" were very clever and worked for me. The different version of Strawberry Fields is a favorite. George's acoustic version of ""While My guitar gently weeps"" is absolutely awesome. In my opinion that song could be re-released today as a new single.For the die-hard fans who don't want the originals ""messed with"", consider the fact that it is George Martin doing it. That should be reason enough to appreciate it. Either way, I am a HUGE HUGE Beatles fan and I thoroughly enjoy this CD and would recommend it to others.",1
"An Orgasm for the Ears: This was an experience, an orgasm for the ears. I was a bit skeptic about it, thinking it would be like those awful jazz albums with a techno beat. This was far from that and far from awful. I was amazed by how new this sounded. I really felt like The Beatles themselves had recorded this today. I really felt the spirit of the music.I can't say enough good things about this album, except that it made me happy. That is the feeling you get from 'Love' and you can feel it when you are sitting there, submerged in 5.1 surround sound. Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant.",1
"A new take on the Beatles: I love the Beatles but I was getting bored hearing the same songs for the last 35 years. This is the same Beatle music but all mixed together in a fresh, new way with alot of energy. It was all familiar yet new at the same time. Really well done!",1
"Not your typical mop top tribute: No, this album is for the true Beatle fan and celebrates their creativity and innovation rather than their successes. Sure you will get your ""Hey Jude"" and ""Yesterday"", but you also get some of the more obscure tunes like ""Within you and Without You"" mashed with the bass from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". There are so many small things added (or taken away) from the songs and it's done so skillfully by George Martin and his son that they are sometimes difficult to detect. One of my favorites is the addition of Paul screaming from ""Helter Skelter"" combined with the heavy guitar from ""She's so Heavy"" being added to the end of ""Mr. Kite"". Awesome mash album for the true Beatles fan. If you're expecting a greatest hits album, look elsewhere.",1
Sorry me! Poor me! I bought it.... This is not worth a penny.. ok maybe one: I'm a huge Beatles Fan.... I grew up singing their songs while in the car with my mom. This CD might sound great on stage with Cirque du Soleil but at work at my desk it really sucks... give me the real songs full lenght and original. This mish mash of sound has nothing but made me want to hold to my old cds..Great songs in this CD but terrible mix...,0
"Very deciving describtion: This is not the Beatles, it is a CD made for ""Cirque do Soleil"" it shoudn't be presented as a Beatles CD because the buyer will expect the songs as they heard them originally, not in this form",0
"The Beatles are great --- and you can make your own mix!: Dear All,I love the Beatles. We all know at certain times love songs hurt and we wish we could sail away on the Yellow Subarmine ,our answer being LET IT BE, and we IMAGINE for a day to get better. We are beyond TRYING TO WORK IT OUT<I DONT SEE IT YOUR WAY etc. This is why I say buy the Beatles from Amazon of course, in the original recordings. Download them to your IPOD or other freiendly MP3 player aand make your own song list or more than one to meat the needs of all of your moods and passions. You should hear my 75 song Christmas play list, a marvel and a joy to have. Joy to the world, make your own. My other playlists all serve a purpose and if I have no purpose I can always hit the shuffle and be suprised!",1
"Fraud: This sells looks like DVD movie and CD music, but the reality is that both are the same, the DVD is not the movie nor even have fotos , just the picture of the cover and the same music that already have the CD. They should put an advice that the DVD is just the same music and have no images.",0
"DVD has no video: The DVD shows the album cover and apparently has no video, just the music in a different surround sound format. Disappointing.JH",0
"Noisy: Listening to this new production of the old songs helped me realize that all that background noise the Beatles added as the years went on didn't help my enjoyment. I just put up with it. But this album is all about that background cacophony. I can understand why a record producer might get off on adding all that sound to ""deepen"" and ""broaden"" the sound, but I'm just a working stiff who likes the Beatles. I listened once, and then never again.",0
"NOT THE REAL BEATLES: Impressionist group - not bad, BUT when you are expecting the REAL BEATLES, it doesn't compare.AMAZON needs to make it clear UP FRONT that this is an impressionist group.",0
"It's pretty bad: They finally release The Beatles in a High Fidelity format and what do we get a Megamix.....snippets of Beatle songs. For a lot of you DJ's out there you know how we hate Megamixes. Come on Apple Records, EMI, Parlophone whoever has the power, do it while we are still alive. The Beatles in it's true form on DVD-Audio, DTS ...... that would be amazing.",0
"Martin adds his greasy thumbprint. Why????: Okay- The scene(albeit fictitous)is a graveyard. Dr. Martinstein and son Giles dig up the graves of John and George, open their caskets, and ask permission to completely 'mess' with their completed works. 'They didnt say 'no'!' is Martin's decision, closing the lids! Thus this product. Okay, clever, well done, great sound (yawn), but WHY??????????????This is akin to cutting up family photographs just to insert one's own face. I think it's abysmal, if only for intent. Why Ringo and Paul would ever sanction this is a mystery to me. I got it for Christmas, but it'll most likely end up on ebay, as i aint gonna open it!",0
save your money: When I bought this cd (from Barnes and Noble) i thought to myself this is going to be great listenting. What is it? songs sung by the beatles that sound like they're high or stoned or whatever. Most of the songs are awful there are only two I liked. Please don't waste your money.,0
Love/refund: I returned this item weeks ago and still have not received a refund. I am really not happy with your service right now.,0
"DESERVES NO STARS WHATSOEVER: It seems in the state of California [and perhaps nationwide] you can not return a CD, due to copyright laws, even when it's deceptively packaged.In the retail store [I knew I should have previewed it on Amazon] you have absolutely no indication that this is not really a Beatle's recording. It was not until I opened it and listened to it and had access to the INSIDE of the jewel case, and voila, the true nature of this CD's origins are made clear - it is a horrible mishmash of sounds and lyrics and junk. I explained my dilemma to the Target customer service rep, but I had no recourse. I hate this CD and no one should waste this kind of $ to purchase it - I could have spent my $15 on Magical Mystery Tour. Lesson learned: Always check with Amazon before buying a product you're unfamiliar with.",0
"How about something for REAL fans, like a DVD-A or SACD of Abbey Road for instance?: When will EMI get off their duff and give us surround mixes of the later albums (the ones that were done in at least 4-track)? Or maybe go back to the original tapes and press some nice vinyl. This album is an insult.",0
Great Album: A wonderful new way to listen to the Beatles. Martin is masterful in his blending of Beatles songs. This is a must have for any Beatles fan!,1
"Definitely worth buying...: Pick up some really good headphones while you're at it (trust me..). It's impossible to pick out all of the subtle samples from Beatle songs as they are sprinkled here and there. Some are very obvious but a lot of the time you find yourself going 'I know that, but I don't know where I know it from; what song is that??'. I think that was the idea.There was a bit of a wtf moment when I popped in the DVD and was disappointed to see the logo on my screen with just the music playing in the background. It would have been better to have some kind of images or SOMETHING rather than just staring at the stupid logo.",1
"an irritating mess: First of all, I love a good mashup. DJ Dangermouse did a great job combining the Beatles and Jay-Z. But nobody should get away with taking existing perfection and trying to make it ""slicker"". George Martin had to have known on some level this was a pander to far. To hear the start of a song you have always loved, then hear it has been monkeyed with for a new cash grab by the label is putrid.",0
"AHHHH: What can I say? Beatles, LOVE, remastered for Cirque du Soleil, and a fantastic buy! Enjoy enjoy enjoy. It's not like the tracks you are used to.",1
"Tantalizing mashings of original Beatles songs: First, I've been a Beatles fan since I was 14 in 1964, watched all their live performances on the Ed Sulllivan Show, and attended their two concerts Seattle, Washington. Second, do not buy this album if you expect to hear Beatles songs as originally produced and released. It's not the album for you, and you will be disappointed. But, third, do buy this album if you want to hear Beatles songs mixed and mashed lovingly in unique ways. The production is by orignal Beatles producer George Martin and his son, and they know what they're doing--with the approval of the Beatles and their families.",1
"An unforgettable listening experience: ""Love"" is not just another Beatles album, it is an unforgettable listening experience. This is as close as we will ever get to a new Beatles recording. I wish I had a way to contact Sir George Martin and Giles Martin. I would like to personally thank them for what they have done. Every time I listen to this ""Love"" I feel like I am 16 years old again.To all the purists who are screaming foul: Paul and Ringo love this CD, so why should anyone else complain? If you don't like it, don't listen to it.",1
"Pause for thought!: Well, the fans are really divided about this one. As a lifelong Beatles fan I have to say that I think it's worth $10 of anyone's money, but it will mean more to people who appreciate the Beatles significance in the history of popular music. What struck me most about this CD was the incredible improvement in sound quality over previous releases - for example, the bass lines are so clear but so are all the other instruments and voices. If nothing else it gets you thinking and wondering what the Beatles would have sounded like if they had had today's sound recording and reproduction technology all those years ago. They couldn't improve on the quality of the songs themselves - just the way they were recorded and reproduced. And that is what 'Love' does so well!",1
"Love It: An excellent compilation and remixing of the Beatle's canon. Fresh takes on still-fresh compositions. No group has ever approached the consistently high standards of The Boys, except for perhaps George Martin himself, who's input and taste underpin this collection. A must-have for the Beatles fan of any age or degree of devotion. It's, uh, Fab!",1
"Love That Mash Up: I can't decide whether I like this cd or not..but, I have listened to it a lot, so I guess that indicates something favorable about it. By my lights (and ears) Apple has been uneven in its post breakup releases, with the Anthologies marking an especial low point, but Love is probably a must have for those of us who love the Beatles. Just for the record, there's plenty of more incisive Beatles mash ups out there (on bootleg) that mix up Beatles tunes with non-Beatles music (e.g., ""Let it Be"" mashed up with a reggae song). But still, it wouldn't be Christmas without a new release from a band that broke up before your mother was born, would it?",1
"Watch Cirque du Soleil and listen to The Beatles !: If you truly like Beatles' music there's no need to buy this CD (no new music !), instead listen to the original music as it was released in the 60s on vinyl, and, later on, remastered on CD. Use a computer to create your own mixing, and, as I did, add post-Beatles material from each of the Fab Four solo career. Of course, the ""Love"" DVD Audio version offers 5.1 multi channel sound, but, believe me, the vinyl's Mono version is all I need !Buy this CD after you watched Cirque du Soleil's oustanding show to remind you of it. The show - it's the only way to ""watch"" The Beatles now ! Great show, great music - 'will last forever !",1
"That rustling sound in some of the tracks is the money leaving your wallet: I beg to differ. This is a rip-off. The CD remixes may be masterful, but one has the sense that a bright 14 year old with Garageband could do something much like this. Most annoying is the DVD. Expecting old footage, or even something from Cirque du Soleil--after all, the liner notes tell you that that's the premise for this thing? Guess again. There's a single image that remains onscreen for the duration of album, an image that stays before you as you presumably wallow around on your floor marveling at the Surround-sounded remix. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss twenty bucks good-bye.",0
Beatles: I don't like the treatment given to the songs. It's better to just buy the regular Beatles number one hits.,0
"Reinventing the ""Wheel and Deal"": The chief question this misguided CD raises is -- why in the world do you try to remix songs that were perfect to begin with? The answer, of course, is that there is a new generation of money-spending boys and girls who can plunk down $25 to hear someone's garbled retake on that perfection. That the ""someone"" in this case was once affiliated with The Beatles does not excuse this money-grubbing, but seems to make it all the more egregious. For God's sake, kids, just get the real thing. This watered down semblance gives you the the wrong idea.",0
"Not what I expected: This CD was not what I expected, the music is not The Beatles, some is , some is not. It's more Broadway than anything.",0
"Unecessary and pointless: This album is a complete waste of space and does not deserve to have been made. I am not going to fight and try and prove just how much I love the Beatles... Too many of us have made such statements to show to our fellow readers that our review is objective and all that jazz... Let's just say that this album is the final nail in the Beatles' coffin... Making sounds with prerecorded music, so that the masses can watch a bunch of talented - but incredibly uninspired - acrobats do pirouettes to this sterile and pathetic muzak, may convince some of us that there is a transcended value to all of this... Don't be fooled!!! There isn't!!! This album is total crap and bringing life to dead matter just doesn't make it any better... Frankenstein failed and so do these people... Free as a Bird wasn't bad enough... What's next, a production of the Rolling Stones Satan's Request? Oops, I've just given them an idea...",0
"Fascinating collage & combination of FABS tunes: The FABS sound great ! George Martin & son Giles created a fascinating combination & collage of Beatle tunes ! The drumming on Tomorrow Never Knows inside Within You Without You, the bass lines on Hey Jude, the trio The Word/What You're Doing/Drive My Car, the beautiful sparce Harrison solo version of his While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the revamped Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite.....the list goes on and on !",1
A feeling of excitement: I listened to the CD and it gave me that feeling I experienced when I first heard Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road for the first time. That's a good thing! Nobody knows the tracks better nor could have improved them without Sir George Martin at the helm. Give it a spin and feel like a kid again.,1
"With Our Love, We Could Save the World: I can't even begin to tell any Beatles fan how amazing this album, and show, is. After a long 3 years of waiting to turn 21, my man took me to Las Vegas to celebrate. I had only seen one other Cirque du Soleil show before, but was convinced I would like it just because it was set to the wonderful music of The Beatles. Was I ever right!! This show is so moving, mostly in part to the strict care given to the show's ever-important soundtrack, a collection of mostly re-produced Beatles songs (a few remain mostly untouched) produced by four gentleman, including George Martin, the original Beatles producer, and his son. Any Beatles fan will more than rejoice in this loving mix of the Beatles' best. Be sure to purchase this, especially if, like me, you have basically the entire Beatles catalogue. There will never be a truer celebration of the world's greatest rock band. I love you Beatles!",1
"An audio collage indeed: Having virtually every album the Beatles made (that were available in the U.S.), I never had a doubt that they were the best pop musicians in the world. I remember my 70 year old grandmother bouncing to the tune ""Love me do,"" as she was ironing. This album is a type of closure for me, for I grew up with the Beatles. I was 12 when JFK was assassinated (1963), and the world was in a dark hole, mentally and spiritually. Then the Beatles seemed to appear from nowhere. They were like voices from above that reassured us everything was going to be alright, and that ""Love"" truly was the answer. Unfortunately, like other universal themes, its message still escapes humanity, but its nice to know we have a time capsule in this album we can revisit in our own way and appreciate what the Beatles did for us with their obvious talent (ahead of its time) and timeless message.",1
"Great Beatles Remix with Obvious Cirque du Soleil Overtones: If you like Cirque du Soleil, you will love this mixing of classic beatles songs. The album flows really well, but it is obvious that it was rendered for a performance. It seems a bit dark for a beatles album, and especially one titled love, but has some great remixes nonetheless.",1
"Spiced-Up Reprise of Classic Beatle Tunes +: This is a great eclectic re-mix of the best of the Beatles.What the Martins should have done,was re-mix the obscure songs of their portfolio.That would have been true Beatlemania Magick !Yet,no true Beatle fan can disagree with this psychadelic respective from the gem vaults of the music masters,George Martin and Son.Enjoy the new twists on the long and winding road!",1
"Wonderful: This is easily the best album in 30 years (but that's not saying much). If The Beatles were recording today, this is the kind of album they would release. It captures the inventiveness and fun they introduced to music. I do recommend listening through headphones or ripping it to an iPod/MP3 player so you'll catch all the subtle sounds. George Martin and his son Giles have created a masterpiece.To describe myselfL:I'm 55 and have always considered myself a fan, but not a fanatic.",1
"Beatles via Cirque du Soleil: The Beatles / Love: Before I say anything else, you do know that this is a reworking and editing of classic Beatles songs created for a Cirque du Soleil performance, right? I only ask because, apparently (judging from the 1 and 2 star reviews on this page) there are over 80 incredibly dull persons who bought this disk and then complained that this wasn't an `original' Beatles hit disc. Please, if your looking for a greatest hits disc, this is NOT it. Now, as to this George Martin re-imagining of the Beatles songs to fit into this `circus' performance, It's really very entertaining and refreshing. I enjoyed the music very much. Good job Mr. Martin! It's not a masterpiece (as it was created for a circus) but it is worth hearing and owning.Four Stars.",1
"All You Need is Love: Well, not quite. If I hear one more person call this a ""mash up"", I'm going to . . .Simply put, this album rules. Sgt. Pepper was FORTY YEARS AGO this year. I remember vividly getting my first Sgt. Pepper CD at the 20-year anniversary of the record, when CDs were still quite new. I still have it. It felt so vivid, fresh and NEW. Well, I had given up hope that anything Beatles related would ever feel new again. The anthologies were good, but they didn't quite cut it. This record breathes new life yet again into the best rock music ever. Try it out in DTS or DD 5.1. It's the bomb. Before those tapes disintegrate, I hope George or Niles can re-master everything in the catalogue plus anything else decent that has never been released. Hopefully my old ears will still be good enough to appreciate it all.",1
New twist on some classic music: We have known and appreciated the complexity of George Martin's producing for over 40 years. Now we can appreciate the genius of its simplicity. It's almost as if he had this CD in mind when he originally produced this music. I love it and am looking forward to more.,1
"Beatles ""LOVE"": I would have given this product 5 stars because the music composition and arrangement and its correspondence to the Cirque was just phenomenal. I have never heard this type of arrangement before with the Beatles library of music and it was very interesting. I love listening to it. The drawback to this particular product was the DVD portion. If I would have known its content I would have only purchased the CD. The DVD only shows the album cover on your TV screen while you listen to the same music that is on the CD. I thought there would be at least some sort of slide show from the Cirque or something more to the DVD than merely one picture of the album cover and music. I still love the music though.",1
"You'll Either LOVE It or Hate It: I fall in the former group. Now before you send the Blue Meanies after me, hear me out. We fortunately have the exquisite originals, so I feel comfortable in enjoying this new treatment of these much loved songs. The only new one I didn't care for was ""Because"". However, the other offerings were truly a joy to hear. I loved the layered songs, and though it's nearly sacrilege, I really liked the new ""Hey Jude"". It works especially well for those that have less than enough patience for the original seven minute version as it is only four.If you are a Beatle fan, you should add this. If you've never heard them (which I can't imagine at all) then this would be a very good introduction (but do go back and get the REAL versions).Dino SmithChattanooga, TN",1
A Great New Collection: This CD is great. I saw the show in Vegas and itbrinngs back great memories. The sound quality isexcellent!!,1
"Best song on the CD....: ...is the absolutely beautiful arrangement of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". I saw the show in Las Vegas and was immediately captivated by this new arrangement. I'd always liked the ""White Album"" version, but this one just melted my heart. When I listen to the CD, I always end up hitting the replay button at least once to listen to it again. The harmonies in the strings are just breathtakingly beautiful. Kudos to whoever is responsible for this new Beatles treasure. The show itself is wonderful. After it was over, I realized my cheeks ached a little because I just couldn't stop smiling! Even my husband, who is rarely swept away by ANYTHING, used the word ""fantastic"" when we were talking about it.",1
"Beatle fans...: Beatle fans will enjoy this Beatle remix especially on vinyl, if you are not a ""purists"" and object to any Beatle music being remixedin the first place. Consider that George Martin and his son remixed the Beatles music who could have done a better job?",1
"Beatles Love On DVD-Audio: This review pertains to the DVD-Audio soundtrack, although it might also be useful to readers to point out that above all, this album is a wonderfully entertaining piece of work particularly and especially to those who are very familiar with the music of the Beatles. The mixing is very creative and imaginative, inspired no doubt by similar qualities of the original compositions. What is even more noteworthy is the fabulous clarity of voices and instruments in comparison to the CD format. I was able to hear sounds never before revealed making it a delight from beginning to end. The highs are transparent, crisp but not overdone, while the lows seemingly transcend the audible range and wind up somewhere between your subflooring and celiac plexus as they ideally should! Just a very pleasant journey through ""Beatle Land,"" and done so with a nod towards those who appreciate brilliant sound quality.",1
"Imagine Something Over Hyped and Not Imaginative: I'm highly disappointed after hearing all the hype. I can't believe it bought into it. I make fun of my husband for buying all the ""new"" Doors CDs. Like ""Light my Fire"" is great, but how many versions do you need. Likewise with Lady Madonna and Hey Jude. Once was enough. I wasted my money on this effort. Well, at least, it has a new Strawberry Fields Forever. That's my consolation. Wait for it in the cut out bin.",0
"oh yoko...: oh yoko you did it again. I love The Beatles, but what has been done in this CD is unremarkable.",0
"The Beatles are BACK!!!: The sound of The Beatles from a different perspective. Alternate versions, productions, mixes and song transitions create a fresh new twist on these classic songs. Guaranteed not to disappoint. This is my new favorite CD!!!",1
"Interesting twist on a good thing.: While many people are crying fault, due to the fact that this has to be the thousandth release of a Beatles album in the last decade alone. It actually turned out damn good.While at first you may feel that you have been burnt at it's initial tracks, but this CD isn't about the individual tracks but, acts as a single entity. Which of course is to be expected considering that it was a ""cirque du soleil"" soundtrack.Over all I recommend it wholly.",1
"Bob Gitzen: I loved this reimagining of the Beatles but I've got a question that I hope someone could answer. When I play the DVD-audio disc on my DVD-audio player (on a stereo system) I'm given no option to listen to a high resolution stereo mix. I thought a seperate Hi-res stereo track was required. When I put the disc in a regular DVD player the ""audio"" option pops up and I can choose PCM stereo. But not on my DVD-A player (Yamaha DVD-C750). Every other disc I own has a hi-res stereo option offered in ""setup"". No such ""bullet point"" appears on the Yamaha for this disc. Is Apple ignoring the rules, or am I wrong about that.",1
"Mo' money.: I did grow up in the 60s, but even if I hadn't, I could recognize this CD as another way to milk the Beatle name for mo' money. I'm not a purist by heart, I'm not upset by this CD release, and taking chances is necessary to explore new musical depths, but this fails. This CD was a gift, and so I guess it's the thought that counts; the buyer knows the Beatles are number one in my opinion. I won't tell them if you won't, but if they want to borrow it and forget to give it back, I won't remind them, either. I'll have it handy when they come to visit, both to tempt them to borrow it and to let them know I haven't thrown it out.",0
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED: This is not a greatest hits album---I should have read the reviewsbefore purchasing---I do not care for the way the material is presented,0
Will not disappoint.: Can't go wrong with this collection. Every Beatles fan will enjoy this in their collection.,1
"You have to be there..............: We went to the Mirage in Vegas to see the show, prior to buying the CD. I know that everyone doesn't have $150 per ticket to spend, but for those who love the Beatles, you have to go.I was completely blown away by the sound system. Even the seat headrests have speakers in them.What a wonderful mix done by Sir George. I will never forget it. This is nostalgia extremis. I love it.",1
"This is pretty awful.: This mishmash should have been titled ""Mucking Around With Some Beatles Songs."" The basic music is some of the excellent music of the Beatles, which has been with us now for a very long time. It appeared to be a good idea to someone to sample pieces of a lot of songs and then mix them in and out of each other to make something. Unfortunately, it comes out as cobbled and patched, with unsatisfying abbreviations of many songs, and jumps between songs which are mostly jarring. The songs themselves each had beauty, integrity and even dignity. This collection sounds like a bad motel lounge singer's routine. I can discern no sense or purpose in this album, except the continuing need for money from which the Beatles empire suffers. This is a ""must-not-have"" for Beatles fans, and if anyone out there doesn't have the original recordings, I'd save my money and buy them instead.",0
"poo on a shiny plastic disc!!!: Man this is bad - so bad i would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys or Brtiney Spears. But it's the Beatles i hear you cry!!!! You wanna know why i think it's crap - because it adds nothing to their legacy and gives EMI or whoever a chance to make more money of their back catalogue. These mix-ups are not inventive or even vaguely interesting, just a few sound effects here or there. Save some money and buy say a Wings album like London Town or Red Rose Speedway if you need a new Beatles fix.",0
"Garbage Can Please: I have been a Beatle's fan since 1964. i saw them in concert in 1966. I own every Beatles album in existance as well as the matching CD for today's digital world. In my opinion they are the best that has ever been or will be.I received the ""Love"" CD for Christmas and have been looking for a discreet garbage can to deposit it into ever since. This is by far the WORST Beatle's collection I have ever owned and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason.",0
"No no no no no no no: Given one by my daughter, so not paid for. Bloody weird. Like a halucination of the Beatles. Cant be bothered trying to name all the bits. They all are recognisable, but....why? When you think in terms of Las Vegas it just becomes awful. Where are the woolly rough edges? The bits that went wrong but sounded great. Like Twist and Shout. This is a digitally perfect horrowshow. A George Martin dream of what he would have done at the time. But being done now, it's Lloyd Webberish gibberish. And as for Octopuses Garden.... God help us. The only comparison is Wordsworth chucking out all his youthful visons of nature in favour of his revisionist old age cant (sic).I think Lennon would have booted it into touch. Well they wouldn't have had to do it would they, if he were still around. Just got Macca in a headlock and written some new stuff...- Derek Taylor",0
"Love is all you need: besides all the others Cds from the Beatles. Love is a masterpiece. The Dvd should have something else besides the songs. Anyway, I LOVEd it.",1
"Fantatsic!!!: I keep telling my friends that they have never heard the Beatles like this. I was blown away, hearing details in the music I had no recollection of whatsoever...and I was a huge Beatles Fan, like all little girls. Gave a copy to my son in Iraq to share with a note that if it is true that music is universal, THIS is a fine example.",1
"Blasphemous: This release is a blasphemous release. It butchers the Beatles' music in ways I could never have nightmares about. It is an uncreative, pointless album. Most of the songs play as normal, with a few interspersed samples from other songs thrown in for good measure. It's like they didn't even try to create huge differences, so it isn't even that creative. Furthermore, the remixes completely ripped the soul out of the music as originally intended. It rips out some of the best parts of songs, such as the end of Revolution or the chorus at the end of Hey Jude. It uses the crescendo sample from A Day in the Life far too much. In a nutshell, it massacres and dessicates the way these songs should be heard. If you MUST hear this music, copy a friend's CD, but don't say I didn't warn you.",0
"Why?: Why would we need this? Why, because we are bored with the originals? Not hardly I hope. This Photoshop-like Beatles CD collage is an insult of great works that needed nothing to make them desirable to be listened to ""again"". The music never stopped being listen to. This CD reminds me of the crass colorized versions of classic black and white movies just so they could hold the attention of the feeble minded tv brains. The only positive thing this CD does is make it clear that the master tapes need to be gone to again as a source to reissue normal recordings once again as the latest technology is far better than it was when the first CDs were made in the 80's - and only George Martin should do this - without his clever son. I wish Amazon could let me give this CD a rating of zero or less, or less than even that.",0
Disappointing: This could hae been awesome but they tried to do too much. Sun King backwards??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Give me a break! That is totally ridiculous and an insult to the Beatles legacy. About half of this works (and the sound is magnificent) and the other half belongs in the garbage. Avoid.,0
A whole lotta of ....what?: I heard the podcast on NPR and was blown away. The sound quality was awesome! I purchased the japenese deluxe version. Save your money. The Dolby 5.1 is OK ( but not great) and CD is unlistenable. My vinyls lps and tape loops are better. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! DOWNLOAD THE PODCAST,0
"If I could give it 0 stars...: The truth is I am very unhappy with the cd release. I can understand the reasons why they produced the album, and why many would like it. But I was expecting a much different album where they mixed and sampled the different tracks in order to create brand new songs. A few added riffs or segues doesn't necessarily improve a song, and in general I felt that the ""new"" songs sounded too close to the originals (in some cases, identical). If you expect a revolutionary change to the classic Beatles songs, then it'd be better to look for something else.",0
"no 5.1 sound: i had three different dvd's and none would play on my system, the music is great but the 5.1 surround sound is not there. very disappointed",0
Awful: This was given to me as a gift. I believed it to be another hits collection. I found out that George Martin and son had fricked-up some of the greatest rock n roll music in the world. Why would anyone tamper with what was one of the greatest song writing teams and music groups that was the Beatles. If George Martin needs money I'll send him twenty bucks but please leave the classics alone.,0
Ran it over with my truck: Talk about making a poor shopping choice. I wanted to buy a collection of Beatles songs as a gift for my husband's 60th birthday. The album cover has no warning that this is a remix of circus music. Isn't there a law against this? This is truly an acid trip gone bad.,0
"One star is too much.: George and Giles Martin (and whoever else is involved) should be ashamed of themselves. If you truly love the Beatles, do not buy this album.",0
"Another negative from a die-hard fan: I just don't see what the hype and the praise for this CD is all about. Anyone with technical expertise could have mixed the songs from the 13 studio albums (""Please Please Me"" to ""Let It Be""), along with the singles that were never put on albums (that are on the two ""Past Masters"" CDs) and blended them together like they are here.To me, this further cheapens The Boys' legacy. How many mixes can there be of the same songs? This whole thing just screams ""Minimal amount of work for maximum profit."" There's just nothing to this except trying to further capitalize on The Beatles' name (and I don't get the hype about Cirque du Soleil, either).I have to disagree with Amazon's featured review on this page: I don't need this CD for ""inspiration"" to go to the studio albums. I listen to them everyday regardless.Truth be told, I really don't care what the casual and fly-by-night fans think. From a die-hard, I don't ""Love"" this at all! - Donna Di Giacomo",0
"i need help: even I do not receive the product, I need its aid to locate it, or send me an I number of guides or reference",0
"Buy a Geniune Beatle CD instead: As a collector of Beatle CD's, LP's and 45's with over 4200 items I feel that EMI has really had a good laugh at the collectors expense. This is NOT the way these songs were ever meant to be heard, either from the Beatles or the record companies standpoint. With all the quality music that the Beatles have given us I think I would rather buy the soundtrack from the god awful Beatlemania play. This is capitolism at it's worst. I would of given this 0 stars if allowed but I must admit the sound quality it quite good.",0
"Outstanding Remix: Featuring music compiled and remixed as a mashup for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name, This album contains very creative versions of Beatles song, re-engineered by George Martin and his son Giles. Much more than merely remastered or remixed, it is a collage of many songs interlaced with one another. The end result is a fresh take on the classic Beatles spirit. This album is a treasure for the dedicated Beatles fan.",1
"John and George are rolling in their graves!: What is the point to this thing? It is disturbing to listen to, what's next, rap mixes? Disco mixes? I grew up in the 60's, I'm a purist and enjoy the Beatles music as they intended it to be listened to. I can't imagine Paul and Ringo blessed this. Why don't they release the fan club Christmas album? Hey Jude 3:58? I don't think so.",0
"Like a dream: Listening to ""Love"" is like dreaming of the music of The Beatles. It's fun. It's well done. It sounds great. And it's no doubt the perfect soundtrack to the Love show. But ultimately, it's the kind of taste that makes me hunger for a remastered Beatles catalog. I want to hear the real thing sound this good!",1
"A Magical Remix Tour: If producer George Martin were not involved in the ""Love"" project, I would have avoided this CD like the plague. Happily, Martin (with son Giles) has reimagined the Beatles' catalogue in exciting new ways. The best moments in ""Love"" are the most audacious, such as the seamless remix of ""Drive My Car,"" ""The Word"" and ""What You're Doing"" - not to mention layering the vocal track from ""Within You Without You"" over the instrumentation of ""Tomorrow Never Knows."" Admittedly, some remixes are dispensable (notably ""Because,"" ""Help!"" and ""All You Need Is Love""), yet the overall effect is quite entrancing. As a musical entity, ""Love"" succeeds in erasing the bad taste of 2003's ""Let It Be . . . Naked.""",1
"Inspired, but could have been Sublime: I absolutely love this album, it hasn't left my mp3 player since I bought it! Several of the tracks (Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing, Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter, Here Comes The Sun/The Inner Light) are so good, it almost makes the inner Beatles fan want to giggle :) The transitions are so much fun (often very trippy but somehow still clean) and I love spotting which bits have been put where.. that said, I wish there were more of this in the album. Some of the songs have been very nicely paired down to create a cleaner overall experience, but some of the tracks sound basically exactly the same as the original. If George Martin had just taken a little bit more of a step out of the original tracks, this would have jumped to the top of my favorite Beatles albums! Still great though, definitely worth the buy..",1
"The Beatles remixed and reworked into a beautiful sound collage!!! Groovy baby!!!: Great job Sir George Martin and son Giles for remixing and reworking these timeless classics into a beautiful,colourful soung collage for the mind!!!,and of course the Beatles(John Paul,George and Ringo) themselves for creating such timeless music that will live on for eternity!!! It's been reworked but it works here in spades!!! Just pop in Love in the CD player and enjoy the Beatles as never before!!! They might have broke up ions ago but the music live on!!! It's groovy baby,Austin Powers would love this!!!Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+",1
"I love ""Love"": This is a great remastering of classic Beatles hits. Listening with headphones is the only way to really appreciate the remastering.",1
"excelent: Every arregment has been very carefuly, it doesnt change the soul of each song, but when i saw that it comes with DVD I thought it was with some videos but it is actually an audio DVD, I felt disapointed with that surprise.",1
"Delightful fruits of a friendship between George and Guy Laliberté: The liner notes provided by Sir George Martin are alone worth the cost of 'Love' - they reveal a friendship between George Harrison and Cirque founder Guy Laliberté as the inspiration behind the Cirque-Beatles link-up. As a result, the songs presented on 'Love' are probably a bit 'George-heavy' when measured vs. the recorded history of the Fab Four as a group. But who's complaining? As a George fan, it's nice to see him get rewarded. He was always the true 'explorer' of the group.That said, the music that stands out on 'Love' is Lennon's. The urgency of ""She's So Heavy,"" ""Come Together"" and ""Glass Onion"" is incredible. It was especially great to hear 'Onion' - I hadn't heard that in years. It's brilliant. And ""I Am the Walrus"" - even 40 years later - simply dazzles as a imaginative and technical tour de force.I've not seen the Cirque show, but hearing 'Love' makes me want to book a special trip to Vegas to see it.",1
"The Beatles as you've never heard them before: At a small outdoor concert this August, during an intermission, the Love album was played over the sound system. My ears pearked up & listened carefully: this WAS the voice of John, Paul, George & sometimes Ringo, but it WASN'T any of the originally released versions of the song. Since I own all the Beatles, WHAT IS THIS ??It was the Love album, a remix of 26 of the best of the Beatles by George Martin & his son. Songs include the biggies: Hey Jude, Eleanor Rigby, I Am the Walrus, Help, Within You Without You, LSD, While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, Sgt. Peppers, etc.A few songs have very minor changes. Most, however, are substantially changed in some way, tho the vocals generally are what we are all intimately familiar with. One song, Grik Nus (Sun King spelled backwards) is a song that works entirely backwards!All in all a very creative reworking of the Fab Four we fondly miss so much. And well worth the price of an album, esp at the $8 I paid!",1
"One word.: I'm a lifetime Beatles' fan, and have been playing this 'Love' album frequently since it was first was released. All I can think when I listen to this album is one word: ""Whatever."" It is almost ridiculous how talented and innovative the Beatles were/are. Kinda makes me wonder why anyone else has bothered since...",1
"Reinventing the Beatles!: George Martin has taken a huge risk and it pays off handsomely. Taking portions of the Beatles vast collection of popular songs and remixing them into one 78 minute musical experience is dazzling. Each song is remastered flawlessly and seamlessly edited into one another with a vast interspersing of original Beatles sound effects and orchestration. While you hear one song with the band, there might be a sound byte from another songs background mixed into the complete experience. It's a non-stop joy ride from the a capella of ""Because"" to the finale of ""All You Need Is Love"". It's all Beatles and it's all fantastic. The DVD expands on this brilliant idea and reproduces the sound in 5.1 digital surround. This is not the `best' of the Beatles - it is the `genius' of the Beatles!",1
"I grew up with these guys: It's a very nice album. As the liner notes say it sounds as fresh today as it did 40 years ago. Putting the disk in the CD player is like having a warm visit from beloved old friends.I'm not much of a fan of moldy goldy, but I've been listening to this album, Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago's debut album,) both incarnations of Blood Sweat and Tears, etc. And in one respect it all makes me very sad. I grew up in this golden age of talent and creativity--a time when the music was the thing. These three examples are only the the tip of the iceburg of what was happening in the music business back then.Isn't it amazing (and sad) that with all the state of the art, wonderful technology of today that the music doesn't even approach the art of the Beatles, etc?BTW, I got this on a special, I guess, for only $9.99 plus shipping. Really good bang for the buck!",1
"Amazing - I think this is a gem!: I am an avid Beatles fan and have all their official CD releases and loads of their vinyl. Conseqently I am familiar with their music. This album allows you to hear a different spin on some of their most popular, as well as less well known, music. The segues are fascinating and you will also hear snippets from versions other than the officially released tracks. The mixing has, of course, been done on state of the art equipment and is beautifully crystal clear - top marks to EMI for:1) Impeccable original recordings, and2) Preserving those old recordings so well.The clarity allows you to hear into parts of recordings that were previously 'buried in the mix'.I approached this album in trepidation but I have found myself beguiled. Fans and casual observers alike will definitely enjoys this. Roll out the show in Europe please!",0
"Good sound but there is NO Beatles Spirit!: Granted - they did a good job to restore original records to quite a good quality, but they added a lot of garbage sounds as well. I hardly listened the record one time till the end. Lucky me, I borrowed CD not bought it! I would not take it even for free now!!!Bottom line: it is artificialy refined to the point of total spiritless though very good quality, original Beatles records reconstruction. Liveliness and pointless...",0
"Let it Be: George Harrison's demo of My Guitar Gently Weeps does showcase incredible talent. The rest of the material sounded better as originally recorded, arranged, produced and released.",0
Disappointing: I am not a Beatle's purist but I listened to this CD wanting to like it but found it wanting.I felt that it failed as an artistic re-rendering of the Beatle's music and the effort sounded more like a very expensive form of doodling with the original tracks.Very dissappointing effort from George Martin and his son.,0
"My Son Loves It!: Bought this for my 13 yo Beatles nut son for Christmas. He just loves it, we had a lot of fun listening to the different arrangements. He says it was the second best gift he got! (first being a laptop)",1
"You have to experience it: It's the Beatles + Surround sound. What else can I say?? It is amazing! The Love soundtrack is a masterpiece by itself and add to that the awesome 5.1 effects, it's really an experience that if you like the Beatles, you can't miss it.",1
beware the hype: i was kinda of excited about this but actually listening to it is a different story.you gotta ask yourself - do you really want to hear snippets of beatles songs? do you really want these artificial mixes and transitions to get stuck in your head in place the original songs?if you need a beatles fix - i would suggest getting the anthologies (especially 2 and 3) and putting them on shuffle.,0
"Nice: If this wasn't produced by George Martin, then I'd have been skeptical. It's musical threads woven by the master tailer. These are Beatles songs and snipets of Beatles songs that have a different flavor. This is more than a Beatles fan release. Even the dopes who have never listened to the Beatles might like some of this.",1
"Tremendous: First things first, Love by the Beatles, features music that is all from the Beatles original recordings. That said, the starting point for this CD is very strong. If you can get past the fact that there are what amounts to remixes of many of the recordings. I am a firm believer that any music by the Beatles is great music. Love by the Beatles is no exception to that belief. The sound hear is outstanding. There are many of the classic Beatles songs hear, with some eerie renditions and some excellent. There is an ethereal quality to Strawberry Fields and I am the Walrus sounds excellent. This is a must have for Beatles fans. I rate it a strong four stars.",1
"SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET IT: AMAZING THAT ANYBODY WROTE A BAD REVIEW.I'VE BEEN COLLECTING BOOTLEGS FOR YEARS AND WAS AMAZED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE INSERTED ON THIS CD - SOUNDING CLEAN AND FRESH. THE BLENDING OF SONGS WAS FANTASTIC AND KEPT ME SMILING THROUGHOUT, NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT. I ONLY WISHED THE DRUMBEAT CARRIED ALL THE WAY THROUGH ON TRACK 14, BUT WAS STILL GIGGLING ON HOW COOL IT WAS. ONLY 4 OF 5 STARSCAUSE I WISH ALL BEATLES SONGS WERE ON THIS (MAYBE/HOPEFULLY VOL. 2)THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS CD SHOULD LISTEN WITH THEIR HEADS PULLED OUT OF THEIR A**.",1
"Pleasantly Shocked!!!: In all honesty I expected ""Love"" to be yet another re-packaging of tried and true Beatles classics. Then I heard that it was actually the soundtrack to a Cirque du Soleil show and my expecations dropped even lower. I expected nothing short of total cheese. Wow was I surprised. My review? One word. AWESOME!Give it a listen. If nothing else it's really cool to listen to.",1
"Seeing/hearing is believing: Without witnessing the Cirque du Soleil presentation, this album...er CD, loses half of its impact. What goes on between the ears after experiencing the show and then listening to it again is truly remarkable. I'd go to the show again in a heartbeat. Looking forward to the eventual remastering of the Beatles catalogue. This CD is just a taste of what is to come.",1
"WOW: I have, like most people raised in the 60's, every Beatle album made. In every case, I listen to the new release and think, 'yuup, it's them again'. These are usually the same mixes, sometimes 'remastered' but generally the same.Until this one. It is like George Martin somehow got the four back into a modern 2006 studio and made them do it all over again. I have NEVER heard Ringo on the drums sound like this. The vocals are tight and fresh, the mixing is supurb.I am truly blown away by this one. Same songs but they all feel new. Even ""I Want to Hold Your Hand' live sounds like it was done last week.If this were an album (you young people, check Wikipedia if you don't know what this is) I would play the grooves off it and need another.",1
"The Beatles Love: If you really love the Beatles, you probably won't think much of this. A few good (unaltered) tunes. The rest is not so great.",0
"You have not heard this before!: This is an engineering masterpiece. Essentially, this all new work. Any fan will really enjoy this CD. All fans should own this, otherwise your Beatles' collection is incomplete. Again, this is NEW WORK.",1
Beatles Love: This is a great tribute to making the old new and to the musicianship of both the Beatles and the producers of this album.,1
"new twist on old music: I found this CD to be a wonderful twist on loved,old favorites. I recommend this to any Beatles lover who has most of their music.",1
"Encore!!!: You know it's sad when the best album of the year is a collage of recordings that were originally laid down 40 years ago. But it's a well deserved success. I guess what this album really does well is hold to its mission statement: ""You will experience this music in a whole new way"". Not only did George Martin surpass my expectations in the execution, but he was able to give new life to some of the richest, most enduring music on the planet - while satisfying buffs and new listeners alike. It's about damn time the Beatles got some new age treatment. For the first time fans can listen to TRUE stereo & surround sound mixing of (some of) the Beatles catalogue. Crisp, exciting, refreshingly creative. It's as though the Beatles got back together and decided to play an 80 minute studio medley. Bravo. Encore?Best moment: The previously unreleased ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Acoustic)"", with additional lyrics and a backing score written by George Martin.",1
"Disappointing: In my opinion, the Beatles Catalogue should be left alone and not suffer from such remixes. At times the voices sound out of tune and this detracts from the overall listening pleasure.With the amount of media hoopla surrounding each Beatles release it is difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff. In this case, sadly, it is chaff. Disappointing and definately for Beatles fans ONLY.",0
"Highly recommend to any true Beatles fan!: I think it's terrific, gave me goose bumps when I played it the first time. I love the way the songs segue into one another. Good selection of tunes, however, I could have done without ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"". It seems to be a tribute to John & George, which is what it should be.",1
"4 great songs - the rest unnoticable difference: i had high hopes for this one. not unrealistic high hopes, but i am VERY DISSAPPOINTED!I really expected some stellar stuff, songs reinterrpreted and fresh.George Martin is a genious, but he bombed on this one.There are apx 20+ songs on here. They are fantastic songs, but they sound completley unchanged. I feel like I just rebought a greatest hits album I already own! The Beatles songs are gourgeous on their own, but the thing that upsets me, is this album was completely FALSELY ADVERTISED.[...]I originally bought this album after listening to the 4 tracks on the beatles myspace[...]Those songs were so gourgeously redone and are truly novel gems.Bad news, is the rest are so minimally altered, you cant even tell the difference.If you are a purist this is fine, it is like being tricked into rebuying another greatest hits album.[...]",0
"Yawn: It's a big yawner. Anybody with a reasonably respectable Beatles MP3 collection and a $40 computer program (Goldwave) could have created this album. There is frankly nothing new or imaginative. Not only that, the remixes detract from the originals. This music would likely work well in the context of the show, but fails to stand on its own as an album. All the hype is nothing more than yet another McCartney/Ono Christmas money grab.",0
"like painting a fake mustache on the Mona Lisa: Why mess with the greatest music of the 20th Century? To put together another compliation of songs everybody already owns? I am one of the biggest Beatles fans in the world, and this is sacrilege. What they should have done is just remix their old albums and re-release them. Sorry, but this is a classic disappointment and a waste of money, even with surround sound.",0
"Stop Monkeying Around!: First of all, THIS IS NOT A REVIEW ON THE BEATLES MUSIC!This is how it goes: Back in the sixties, a little kid (Rocky Racoon) just out of his diapers got into daddy's closet and thought it would be fan to mess up BIG TIME!And that it what has happened!After listening to this CD I realized that this is like playing with marbles, they can go in any direction and not make sense and this in NOT how The Beatles intended it in the first place. In the original recording the song were so beautifully crafted and brought joy and love to all of us around the world. Yes, the have the love, inspiration...Listening to this was just a sequence of annoying surprises, pieces Here, There and Everywhere but NONE in the right place. Was this really necessary?The Beatles`s music IS the greatest in the Rock/Pop World. This CD is some else's playtime... NOT WORTHY!",0
"Real worth buying: Besides loving all the material included in this CD, I have to praise the seller for the promptness in sending this item in a very short time.The CD arrived at my address in perfect conditions and the only problem that I am facing is to be able to stop listening to it.This makes me wonder why all the Old CDs by The Beatles are not remastered to this format (DVD-Audio-DTS) because in this way, you are able to catch new sounds in every track they have recorded, something that is simply impossible when you listen to the normal stereo(2-channel) versions.",1
"LOVE this album!: A must-have for any Beatles' fan! George Martin (original producer extraordinaire for the Beatles) and his son Giles have produced an exquisitely mastered product. Highly suggest this double version: CD plus the Audio DVD. Costs MUCH more if you buy it at the actual show at The Mirage in Las Vegas. We purchased this, then went to see the show (which, by the way, has the longest contract EVER for a resident show--ten years!--and we HIGHLY recommend it . . . a true feast for the eyes, ears, and all your senses!), and listened to it while we drove back home. Buy it . . . you won't regret it! Even if you have, like we do, all the original recordings. These newly mastered songs are fabulous!!",1
"What a sound quality!!!: I've attended the live show, and I'd had to try the DVD to check out the sound quality. What a wonderful surprise, it's great. I felt almost like in the Mirage's LOVE Theater. If you compare the Stereo CD with the 5.1 DVD sound, you realize that it looks like a complete different sound experience.The music: It's Beattles!!!The production: Sir George Martin - what a wonderful job!!! Congratulations.",1
"LOVE The Beatles: LOVE (CD + Audio DVD)The sequence of grand classical Beatles music, both words and tunes, have been put together with sublime technical skill. The result is breathtaking for the ears. Did think some video on the DVD would have been available but I guess the video of LOVE The Beatles can be purchased separately. So all in all the CD is brilliant! Purchase and shipping from Amazon was spot-on, in a word excellent. Haydn Deane, Australia.",1
"Do not buy this CD - it is crap: If you are a true Beatles fan, do not waste your money on this CD. It is nothing like the originals. George Martin may think he can remaster the originals but it comes out sounding terrible. It is a sin to try to work some of the greatest songs in the Beatles repetoire into combinations. Had I known this was what this CD was all about, I never would have bought it. This production was made for the Cirque du Soleil and thus was to produce a lot of money. I am beginning to find that their productions are getting too pat and this soundtrack goes along with it. In the beginning Cirque du Soleil was innovative, but like all big money-makers they go stale after a while. This album pulls the Beatle repetoire into the same cesspool. Since George Martin produced so much good Beatles music, it is sad to see him get into this cesspool too.",0
"Full disappointment!: It would be MUCH better to republish ALL originals AS IS, but in high-res SACD.",0
Amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together: I have been a Beatle fan since I was [...]. I even have the White Album on white vinyl. I was excited about the reviews I read so I bought this CD. I was really looking forward to listening to some wonderful Beatles music again.I was so disappointed I gave the CD away. It is a amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together.The songs that were chosen for this CD are already very well mixed masterpieces: i.e. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You/Helter Skelter/Strawberry Fields.So 90% of the work was already done before George Martin's son Giles started thumbing at the controls.It would have been nice to see an array of Beatles songs that were not so commercial or heavily mixed weaved between these songs.Now that would show real mixing skill.Its a good thing that George Martin is almost deaf. I don't think he would have been too happy if he really heard what his son did.,0
"WARNING! Beatles' purists do not buy this CD.: I had to give this CD 1 star because the Amazon rating system would not accept a zero star rating. By looking at the album cover I thought I was buying a new release of Beatles music like the ""One"" CD. This CD is some pretentious idiots' idea of art, to mess up the Beatle's music. In fact the insert contains boastings of these self proclaimed artists. Don't waste your money.",0
"Love?: I being a true Beatle fan from way back to ""62"", you think when you purchase a new revised recording you are gonna LOVE it.I was quite DISAPPOINTED!There are only a few tracks worth listening to......",0
"This DVD is FAKE: I bought this DVD thinking about CIRQUE DU SOLEIL show and what is it exactly? It's only a DVD with no VIDEO, NO SHOW, ONLY SONGS. Why do I need a DVD to play SONGS? I don't need a DVD for this.This is the worst purchase I've ever made in my life. I felt like throwing money to the garbage.TERRIBLE!!!! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS. THIS IS FAKE.",0
"This CD RUINS The Beatles classics!!!: To remain anonymous I have chosen the ""Kid Review"" option(so Amazon please print this review). I just don't know why they would release crap like this...this is NOT true full-length Beatles' versions of their songs. I agree with some of the reviewers out there it sounds like a collage of worthless junk...it really butchers the hell out the original Beatles songs. Beatles on Broadway??? Give me a break!Bottom line: You DON'T go messing with the Beatles classics...End of story!!! FYI: Don't waste your money on this instead go buy their original classics such as ""Revolver"", ""Please,Please,Me"",""Help!"",etc.",0
"The Butchered Beatles: I admit I've never been a fan of re-mix albulms so I'm not surprised this albulm does not appeal to me. Until now I've been fairly pleased with the products that have come out during the past decade to keep making money off of the Beatles, but not this one. I borrowed it from a friend to listen to before I bought it. Thank God I did because I saved myself $12-15.I hate to criticize anything by the Beatles, but really this isn't their fault. Now I just have to hope no one gets me this for Christmas.",0
"I can sum up this CD in 1 word:: ""MASTERPIECE"".Don't deny yourself another day of not hearing this stunning piece of music.It's 78 minutes of joy from start to finish.Put it on,close your eyes,and prepare to be catapulted into a Beatles experience like no other on record.",1
"Disappointing: I thought there would be more mixing of the actual work. A more intricate mosaic, but it was disappointing. All of those tracks of music, vocals, and fxs that can be manipulated, but it was another tribute album. An iconic group, but somebody was afraid to seriously touch those works. I don't blame them, the collection is timeless, but I was not impressed with the attempt. All of the creativity and technology available today to create something respectful and exciting, it fell short. It seems that somebody needed a job, and to assert their name in the public eye, riding on their father's coattails.A Fan of Music",0
Enjoyable Mix: My 19 yr old son bought this cd and I got a chance to listen to it. My husband & I were lucky enough to see Love by Cirque du Soleil and the music was incredible. This cd takes me back to that so I really enjoy listening to it but so does my son who hasn't seen the show. I'm not sure if it's a must have for Beatle fans but would be a fun addition to your collection.,1
"Some minor adjustments but very much BEATLES!: I did not realize(because i didn't read the descriptions all that closely) this is the CD of the Beatles collection they used for the Cirque Du Soleil show ""LOVE"". Other then a couple of minor changes to the music- adding more Orchestra to the songs was one example. So this is not purely just a collection of the Beatles best but still very much a very enjoyable CD. If you want to hear just Beatles skip the first song because i don't think it is the Beatles singing,but the rest are cool.",1
One of the best DVD-A discs out there. Makes their older songs sound incredible!: These 2 discs....the CD and the DVD-A are incredible. The Beatles never sounded so good. You have never heard their songs sound like this!! It is a must buy if you like their music.,1
"Unbelievably fresh!!!: This is an unbelievably fresh take on some great music. This 40 year old music sounds brand new and it's like a Beatles concert might be today if they could perform one. I wanted to listen to it like when I listened to new music as a teenager. In the basement with the lights turned off and the headphones on. I was so moved by this brand new trip down memory lane, this 53 year old man cried at the very end when John Lennon says ""goodnight to you's all"" in his spoken voice. Can't believe somebody murdered him. So many highlights. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" with acoustic guitar and a string arrangement is beautiful. Even songs I wasn't nuts about before are fresh. ""Eleanor Rigby"" stands out as does ""I Am The Walrus"". This mix makes you smile over and over. Get it!",1
"Cirque Du Soleil souvenir: This disc was given to me as a gift, `cause I'm known as a Beatle fanatic around these parts. After being entertained by LOVE for an evening or two, I got this feeling that it will end up collecting dust on my shelf soon, along with the Yellow Submarine Remix and Naked albums. It seems like Apple Records is toying with ""the Beatle fan"" instead of doing the Beatles catalogue justice, they just continue to razzle-dazzle the public with some amusing, yet rather pointless re-releases.I'm sure this disc will be a great souvenir for the Cirque Du Soleil show, and a gateway to the real deal, but not much more than that.",1
"already broken: My son loves the doll, but not as much now that it doesn't talk when you pull the string....well he'll say a 1/2 sentence. This happened relatively soon after getting the doll in the mail...bummer! Not sure if he broke it (he IS 3) or if it is a product defect. I may just cut the string so he forgets he ever talked. Woody's hat barely stays on so I stuck some velcro on it and his head. Works nice....looks a little silly...if I only had brown velcro.Maybe just a plush doll would have been a better buy.",0
"Not Tom Hanks voice!!!!: Very dissapointed, this toy does not have all the phrases from the movie and not even Tom Hanks voice. Only 5 phrases. The doll itself is well constructed but I would not recommend this toy.",0
"Don't bother: We got this toy for our son, a huge fan of the movies. The doll itself is fine and looks just like the original, that is where the similarities stop. First of all the pull cord is fake, sure you have to pull it, but it just activates a digital recording. Secondly, the voice is not even close to Tom Hanks. Lastly, the iconic sayings of the doll are not even there, how can this be? I don't understand why they just didn't make it just like it was on the movies. So if none of those things bother you then go for it, otherwise stay away from this toy.",0
Sheriff Woody's in Town: My grandson had gotten a large Buzz Lightyear at Christmas and he needed a buddy for good times and a bit of rivalry. Sheriff Woody fills the bill. This is a an ersatz nostalgia toy that my 6-year-old understands through the Toy Story movies. I'd have liked it if the hat were soft and formable rather than a stiff bit of molded plastic that sits precariously on the head. I think it would be truer to the kind of toy the sheriff is trying to be.,1
"Disappointed with Disney: When I received this product, it was wrapped in a plastic bag. The pull cord was broken. The toy didn't look new. I bought this toy from Disney because I thought the quality would be of a high standard. I returned the action fiqure, and I didn't ask to replace it.",0
"Sad little boy!!: It is the day after Christmas, and my four year old is already crying!!! He pulled Woody's string this morning and he won't talk!!! My son is so sad!! He did NOT overpull him yesterday, but today, nothing when you pull his string! IF there was an option for NO STARS, that is what I would rate him!!!!",0
"Woody Has Laryngitis: Woody is cool, but he can't talk, which is the whole point of having him around. Not a rootin' tootin' good time by any means. What a disappointment. I see others have had this same problem. Disney and Amazon should get this right -- they have brands to protect and shouldn't be breaking children's hearts when they receive mute Woodys.",0
"So adorable!: This Woody doll is definitely worth the money. It looks so much like the Woody from Toy Story - much more so than either version of the plush doll that is available. His voice sounds pretty similar to Tom Hanks, for some reason I thought that the pull string was just for show and you squeezed him to make him talk. I was happy to see that the pull string was functional! This is a great buy, and such a cute doll. I do wish the hat was attached to his head some how though, that's going to be lost within the week :)",1
"Adorei! loved: Ah, the wood and the king of the children, my children have had two lost. So I just bought another.",1
Big Woody: Purchased for my grandson in Alaska. My son says that the toy is very durable and is played with daily.,1
Talking Woody: It arrived in great shape in time for Christmas! It is the classic talking Woody toy and my daughter loves it!,1
"Defective toy: This was the WORST of all the amazon Christmas gifts that we had chosen!With an autistic NON-VERBAL son;...""TALKING WOODY"" has been his FAVORITE ever sine he saw the movie!!!(*WHICH HE HAS NOW SEEN HUNDREDS OF TIMES SINCE!!*)When he opened it;...his facial expression was absolutely PRICELESS with excitement!!!!......and when he pulled the string to hear him talk;.....IT WAS ASTONISHING!!!!....(to say the least!!!)HOWEVER;....less than 24 HOURS.......THE STRING CAME OUT......WOODY DIED!!!!:(----He was heart-broken!!!I DO WANT TO FIND HIM ANOTHER ONE....BUT HAVE NOT AS OF YET!I MUST SAY, THOUGH, THAT ***AMAZON***~~MADE GOOD ON THEIR PRODUCT POLICIES AND GAVE A FULL REFUND FOR THE DEFECTIVE TOY!!!....HOORAY FOR A QUALITY-ASSURED COMPANY!!NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT **AMAZON**~~WILL BE IN BUSINESS FOR A VERRY VERY LONG TIME AS LONG AS THEIR CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION REMAINS #1 PRIORITY AS I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED!Thanks to all and HAVE A SUPER-prosperous New year!!Ms. T. Lance",0
"terrible all the way around: i know Andy's toys have a ""No Toy Left Behind"" policy, but this is one toy that should be left. five little phrases and it's not even Tom Hanks. i was disappointed but thought my son would play with it anyways. after all he's two, loves anything toy story, and plays with cardboard. i was wrong even he can see this toy stinks. still somehow despite the lack of play, woody's stitches are coming apart. total waste of money",0
Not worth the money paid: This is a cute toy however I wish I would have listened to the other reviews because a day after we had him he stoped talking. He now just spits a word or two out. The string does not work right and if you pick him up sometimes he will say a word or two. NOT worth your money at all.,0
"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!: I am disappointed with this Woody Doll! The doll is O.K. Nothing great about it. Quality is O.K. It doesn't have the original voice, TOM HANKS. Sellers should have specified that it is NOT TOM HANK's voice. Oh well, learn my lesson. Won't buy this specific doll again, if I have seen it from a store for sure.The doll's information (just in case you are interested):Toy Story & Beyond 16"" Pull String Woody Doll by Disney Store (Disney/Pixar); #44196 (B6 486775700114 11).",0
"Very Nice Woody Doll: I Love This Woody, I Had This When I Was Little And I Still Have It And It Is Still Fun To Play By Kids And Your Little One. Defintally Recommended For Your Little Toy Story Fan.",1
"Good value: Well, I was concerned at first after reading other reviews, however my son is happy and Woody sleeps with us every night. Woody only says a few phrases, and has a nose that seems more closely related to Pinocchio. But, the price was right and my 4 year old is happy thus far, no quality issues after one month of use.",1
Woody: Woody served its purpose of surprising our 2 year old grand daughter with a package in the mail...only drawback was a nosy in-law (40 something and possessive) who opened the package before letting the grand daughter know it was hers. As for transaction and doll - everything was perfect.,1
Pull-string broke on the first day of use :(: I think this particular doll was manufactured improperly because we also have Jessie and she has been working for the past two years. I'm hoping to get a replacement soon.,0
VALE LA PENA LA COMPRA: EL JUGUETE ES MUY PARECIDO AL GOODY DE LA PELICULA. LA CARA ES BIEN AGRADABLE. EL DEFECTO ES QUE SUELTA EL CORDEL AL SEGUNDO ESTIRON. ES BUENA COMPRA POR EL PRECIO,0
"Favorite Christmas Toy: We had an early Christmas this year and when my 2 1/2 year old grandson saw Woody nothing else mattered! He is exactly like in the movie and is now the favorite toy. Woody even has ""Andy"" written on the bottom of his boot. The only thing is that he hat falls off and is not so easy to get on.",1
"6 yr old grandaughter loves it: grand daughter loves woody doll. very pleased. Woody preforms as expected, no disappointments. She wants additional dolls in series. Thank you.",1
"Anayrub`s review x): Hello!In general, this toy is excellent. I bought it for my nephew and he has had so much fun with it. I totally recommend this toy to other Toy Story fans like me.",1
Everything you thought Sheriff Woody would be: Except for the voice which is not close to Tom Hanks its a great toy. The pull string has not been an issue either. My daughter loves Buzz more than Woody but he still get a lot of play time. I only wish the hat would stay on better. It fits very loosely and falls off easily.,1
"Great Woody doll!: I purchased this for my son's 5th birthday. He loves all of the Toy Story movies, and has had many of the toys, but wanted the talking ones for his birthday. I ordered this for him, and he loves it! He has played with this doll since he opened it, and even sleeps with it now. The only minor complaint is that the hat fits awkwardly and doesn't like to stay on, but that's not really a huge deal. He loves that he can pull the string and he says the phrases like Woody does on the movies. Overall, I am very happy that I chose this doll because it is a big hit so far!",1
"He carries this around everywhere!: I bought this for my nephew's 4th birthday (since he had 3 Buzz Lightyears and no Woodys!). I love that it is really a model of Andy's toy in the movie. And my nephew, neice (20 months) and daughter (4 years) spent the weekend dragging this toy around. It was thrown and dragged and pulled and is no worse for the wear. They all love it.",1
My grandson loves it!: Woody arrived sooner than expected and in great condition. Grandson loves to pull the string to hear Woody talk. He likes to put the hat on other toys too.,1
"Disappointing: I was so excited to get a woody doll for my son for Christmas, and Amazon had the best price, however Woody's pull string didn't work the moment I pulled him out of the box. He was sent back immediately.",0
"Seems to work: My wife is the primary user and she is very pleased with it. Skin seems to be smoother and without a doubt it shrinks the pore size. The only negative would be with the dispenser, you have to be very careful not to squirt out too much.",1
"I see results: This product has worked great for me. I have only been using it for a week, but so far I see results. My face is smoother and my pores seem to be smaller. I do agree that it does have an odor, but it seems to disappear immediately when it dries. I have had no problems with peeling or it being sticky, but I use a very little bit. Just one pump will cover my whole face. This is a plus since it is a little pricey.",1
"This was disasterous: I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return it for a refund. DermaDoctor needs to go back to med school! Try Dr. Brandt's Pore minimizer instead.",0
"great product!: I would definitely recommend this product to my girlfriends. Having tried many other products, I was pretty much resigned that my pores wouldn't ever look smaller! I don't have bad skin/acne, just large pores and some pock marks from my younger days. But, I gave in to trying this product and it's actually worked. I don't notice the bad smell some of the other reviewers talked about. There was minimal peeling the first time I put on my foundation, but I solved that by using a foundation brush instead of my fingers. I've been using it for almost two weeks, and there is a visible reduction in pore size. One small pump can cover your entire face.",1
I will not buy it again: I bought this product with great hope because of the reviews rating. I had been using for one month now. But it does nothing to my pore. My pore is still large as it is.,0
"Trying it out: So my friend swears by this and she got me to try it out. All of my girlfriends and I are constantly trying out new products and sharing ideas, our husbands are lost, but then I don't know if I really get fishing either so I suppose we're even :P I use Retinol in at least one other product I use for wrinkles that has worked great. If you're concerned about having nice skin and keeping it that way, you should check out my fave five look young products:Lancome Absolue Replenishing Cream SPF 15Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3Relastin, Eye Silk, 0.5 oz, 15 mlSkinCeuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 3ozRoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum 1ozI can't turn back the clock, but I'm not going down without a fight either!",1
"This really works!: When I saw this product on the Dermadoctor website I was really excited to try it. It shows the photos of the clinical trials and how the pores reduced in size. I bought it even though it was expensive and I'm very glad I did. Right away I saw a difference the first time I used it. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and have to say that I can't believe the difference it has made. A bunch of the pores that were enlarged have closed completely, and the ones that were very big have gotten smaller. I'm also using 10% glycolic pads that exfoliates my skin and so I believe that is why my results have been so good. If you have blackheads it will take longer to close the pores because they have to be clear before they can actually close up. It does work very well at removing the blackheads, but if you have a severe blackhead problem your better off going at it with a 2-step approach with the glycolic acid before applying. Especially if you want quick results.",1

"If there was an option for infinite stars....: You may have heard of Greg Rucka through comics. You may have read and enjoyed Detective Comics, Queen and Country, Whiteout, or Elecktra.It's time to put the comics away, and read his Atticus Kodiak series.These books are the best I've read in a long time. You hate and love the characters as if they were real people. Because he writes them as real people. Reading these books are almost like reading non-fiction. It has been years since I've been so engrossed with a series. I am dreading finishing the last one, because I know that will be it until he writes a new one.What are you waiting for? Order them.You'll thank me for it.",1
"Political overtones marred story line and characters: I did not enjoy this book, the story line, or the major characters because of the political heavyhandedness of the author. The major character of the book is an abortionist, whom the author portrays as a heroine. The author is obviously a liberal, and strongly pro-abortion, and felt the need to use this genre to advance his views on the subject. Regardless of your political views, I believe that most people would find the use of this genre to be inappropriate to advance those views. The characters were political symbols and not genuine people.",0
"Poor quality saffron: I normally do not write reviews, but I decided to write one in this case to help fellow buyers. We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron. Despite its steep price, it is not pure saffron. We are seeing instant loss of color when dipped in water. The threads are breaking down almost instantly in water. Also, the taste and aroma are not very rich. I am quite disappointed with quality of the product and will never buy from this seller again.",0
"Great complex quirky prog: This is a German prog band from 1976.This music is very innovative and can be quite complex.It reminds me quite a bit of the English band,Gentle Giant.The musicianship is definatetly top-notch and the song writing is mostly excellent.There are 4 tracks out of 6 that I enjoy.I would actually give these guys a 4 1/2 for this album.The previous album,Plastic People is in the same vein but not quite as good.From what I've read,I wouldn't bother with any of their other albums.If you like complex prog in the Gentle Giant vein where the band seems to throw everything at you but the kitchen sink,without being overly experimental,this is for you.Unfortuneatly the Cd is out of print and can be quite pricey.Maybe get Plastic People and remember this one is at least twice as good as PP.At least then it will give you an idea of the music.Expect lots of time changes,weird synth sounds,along with woodwinds.Great Cd overall.",1
Snowmobile Dolly: I purchased these needing something to move my snowmobiles around. They work very well. Easy to use and easy to store.,1
"Shoddy, better choices elsewhere: I purchased the 1500lb rated set from Northern Tools today. The first time I used the set, the dolly under the snowmobile track blew ballbearings across my drivway. There's cheap, but this is bad cheap even for a chinese product. Spend the extra $10, get a better name brand set.",0
"Best toy around: I think the Litllest Pet shop animals are the best toy because you can take them in the car and stuff like that with you.But when you are in th ecar after dark they don't have a light up screen Also they have this sticker diary where you can get different stickers for doing different things with your pets. You can also hook them up to other animals and then your animal and the other animal dance. It looks so cool. Trust me. And you can also feed, groom and play games with your pet. I love them.",1
Disappointing: Difficult to manuever. Mini games are hard to find and quickly over without allowing any play time. Rewarded with stickers for doing nothing.Sometimes pet gets stuck in one location and even resetting did not help.This item is very frustrating for young children and parents as well.,0
"My favorite book in The Quilt Trilogy.: THE BLUE DOOR was my favorite book in The Quilt Trilogy by Ann Rinaldi. In it, 14 year old Amanda, who is from a Southern plantation, is sent North to Lowell, Massachusetts, by her grandmother Abigail, to make peace with the father Abigail left to marry a Southerner. Only the steamboat Amanda is on explodes. Everyone thinks Amanda is dead. She must pretend she is a worker in her own great grandfather's mill until she can prove who she is. But will she be able to?",1
"Thank Goodness it is Over: Finally, this trilogy is at an end. What a sad, pitiful, disfunctional family. Even for a work of fiction this is stretching things a bit. The plot is unbelievable (even more so than Broken Days) and is basically a repeat of the previous addition to the series. If you would like to see how the trilogy ends - get the book from the library, do not waste the money and purchase it.",0
"The worst book I have ever read in my entire life: I hated this book. It had no plot, what passed for a plot was totally unbelievable. There was no way that the girl would be in that kind of situation. It made no sense at all and was very badly written. If you want to read a book, read something by a good author, like Chrichton. I wouldn't even give this book a star if I didn't have to.",0
Boring business book: This book was relatively boring compared to many other business books. To much detail was given to mundane topics. Not a mentally stimulating book by any means.,0
"Mom...and Loving It!: I used this book for a bi-weekly mothers group, and it has been a big hit. The writers are down to earth, and realistic ladies who understand what it is like to be a christian mother in today's society. They bring scripture into every chapter, and have wonderful words of wisdom for moms with children of all ages. It can be used for large or small groups, studying 1 or 2 chapters each meeting. The words in this book, and the discussions that come from the topics, are extremely motivating to our group.",1
"Mabinogion: This arrived quickly and in good condition. The stories of the Mabinogion are intriguing, full of adventure, and a must-read for lovers of Welsh mythology, or anyone who enjoys stories of the ancient world.",1
"tedious and difficult to read.....: This edition reads like it was translated word-for-word from the original middle welsh. It is written in a stilted, ""translationese"", very difficult and tedious to read. I'm halfway through it ( just finishing up Culwuch and Olwen ) and I think I'll stop....simply can't stand it anymore. There has to be better translations out there than this!!!",0
The Mabinogion (sample): The sample is all from the introduction. There is none of the actual text so it is impossible to judge the readability of the traslation. For that reason I didn't buy it.,0
"The Mabinogian: Simply horrible!I can't imagine this entertaining any one.That said, I suppose it has a small niche out there, some where.",0
"The Mabinogion: A strange little book of Welsh fairy tales. It's not to everyone's taste, but to those who like the strange and historic, it's fun and fascinating.",1
"An Excellent Account of Welsh Celtic Mythology: The Mabinogion is an excellent collection of Welsh Celtic myths/legends. Certain tales are difficult to follow because of a large cast of characters and long list of events/deeds. Nevertheless, the Mabinogion portrays Celtic (Welsh) mythology well. There is an excellent summary of each tale, a guide to pronunciation of names and a map of the region. Together with the tales, these additions make this book exciting and easily accessible.",1
"Strange Tales: The Mabinogion is a collection of ancient Welsh mythlogical tales. The first four stories, called the four branches of Mabinogi, form a coherent cycle. The Mabinogion also contains several pseudo-historical tales, ans several early Arthurian stories. The earliest Arthurian tale ever written(Culhwch and Olwen)is contained in this volume. The Mabinogion takes place in a bizzare mythological world filled with dragons, demons, and faries. Overall, a fascinating read. Well worth a purchase.",1
"Put down that Tolkein!: And pick up the Mabinogion! Lots of captivating stories that lie as close to the roots of the Legends of King Arthur, etc, as we can get. Not the lightest read ever, but often compelling. The introductions to the book as a whole, and each of it's sections, are thoughtful, informative, and reasonably short.",1

"A hypnotic blend of Celtic cool and moody early techno.: Ultravox expand on their trademark distant European synthesizer song by absorbing elements of World and Celtic mythology. Frontman ""Midge"" Ure makes reference to the spirits and stone monuments of his Scottish heritage in ""Man of Two Worlds"", and bares a lovelorn soul in ""A Friend I Call Desire"" and ""When the Time Comes"". This release also features one of Ultravox's final hits, the apocalypse-themed ""Dancing With Tears In My Eyes"". You'll find a more personal, more human Ultravox here...a thoroughly enjoyable set for the U-Vox fan.",1
"Ensure Butter Pecan: I think this is a great product. I use it as a nutritional meal replacement/snack. It contains a little bit of everything to keep me going when I don't have time to eat a well balanced meal, and on top of it all it tastes great. This shake is a great way to ""eat"" something healthy and stay fueled when you're on the go... good value, good flavor, good nutrition. There really isn't anything negative I could say about this product. Perhaps one could complain about too many calories coming in the form of sugars, but for my purposes the extra carbs only add to the ""well-balanced"" formula.",1
Great Product: We buy this product for my father-in-law in Georgia. It's great to know he's getting extra nutrition. The ordering and delivery are simple and quick.,1
"nutrition drink: This drink is tasty and good for your bones and it is a nutritious drink. What I like most about this drink is that it provided 25% of DV = Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet per serving (8fl oz)= one bottle. And nutrition to help get strong on the inside.",1
"Bonus:Tastes Good!: I am type 2 diabetic and have a problem with my blood sugar crashing. Sipping a container of this brings it back up and will keep it up longer than a highdose of a sugar drink,plus it has nutritional value.Great for an easy between meals snack.You can buy a pack at Wal-Mart to try it. A case delivered right to your door containing six packs is a bargain and convenient.Size stores easy in your fridge.Great buy from Amazon,right to your door no shipping charges,PDQ.",1
"Bear McCreary is a genius composer: The soundtrack sounded refreshing and unique. Many of the tracks left a chilling impression on me, especially Passacagl ia, Kobal's Last Gleaming, and The Shape of Things to Come.Two Funerals, and Forgiven has that nice emotional feeling to it.The music that accompanied the battle scenes and tense situations in the show is amazing, the fast beating of drums and etc. enhances the tension. McCreary knows how to compose.All in all, the soundtrack has a wide range of style and sound to it in each track, from Classical Symphony, New Age, and a little bit of Techno.",1
"What: Amazon asked me to make this, but if you are a fan it wont matter it will not matter. If not well let's say this series explores the idea of faith in a different way...",1
"not bad but not great: It was nice to hear the familiar sounds from the show but I was disappointed a little. I don't think the songs were as well rounded as I wanted. In any case, I use it for meditation with only mild irritation.",1
not good: the titles were much too short. Some less than a minute. I'd begin to enjoy it and it was over.,0
"Amazing.: I am a huge fan of the New BG. While watching Season One's episodes, I kept saying to myself: ""I wish I had this music."" Well, now I do. And, it is amazing!!! The composer has taken many differnt types of music from all around the world and blended them together into someting epic. He mixes Tribal, Celtic, Arabic, Electronic, Opera, and Romantic Classical music, and Muzac, into a sound that is compleatly unique, spectacular, emotional, touching, violent, and just about every other description that you can think of. The drums get a little tedious, but in all, this is definitly a ""must hear"".Of all the tracks, my favorite must be the Celtic ""Wonder My Friends"" It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I feel moved every time I hear it.",1
"This really is the Best Sci-Fi Show out there at the moment: If you thought the first soundtrack to the mini-series was good then this goes beyond that. This is just pure sci-fi at its greatness, blending an ethnic vocals over dreamscape and moving music. This really works with the series 1 and in my opinion this is one of the best sci-fi shows that are out that moment, even better than its competitors Stargate SG1/Atlantis.Combining sturring score with a series that has greatness all over it, I'd buy the season 1 also with it, its well worth it.",1
"If you're a fan of the show, you probably already own this.: To start, I got this soundtrack simply because of ""Shape of Things to Come"" and ""Pascagalia"". Those two tracks alone are worth the price. What Bear McCreary does that is refreshing is he takes the standard TV music score and turns it from a simple music cue to feel sad or anxious or happy into an experience in itself--something to be enjoyed independently of the action on the screen. Particularly with the pieces from ""Kobol's Last Gleaming"", he creates orchestral pieces that more than stand on their own as simply enjoyable works. McCreary's music adds a richness to the show that hard to qualify; it's just...there being awesome. Not too bombastic, techno, or new agey, it's always just right.",1
BSG Season 1 Audio CD: Bear McCreary did a wonderful job on this music. It is a true compliment to the brilliant writing of the show as well as to the superb acting.,1
"Available!!: One of my favorite artists, and (IMHO) one of his nicest pieces of work--bluesy, heartfelt, slightly off-center. An underappreciated artist-- perhaps best known for his collaboration with John Hall on the early King Missile albums. It's great to see that this is still available. Shimmyshimmyshimmy disc (they're all great)!",1
"BERRY SPECIAL PETS!!!: I found this DVD to be so cute, just like the other ones. It was great meeting all the different pets in strawberryland! My only ""pet peeve"" is that Blueberry Muffin and her pet mouse Cheesecake were not in the episode at all!They are one of my favorite character duos. That was the only real let down, other than that I would have given it 5 stars. All the pets rule!P.S- Custards whiny, selfish, spoiled attitude kind of got on my nerves in the first episode.",1
"A satisfying, inexpensive version: This lacks perhaps the last ounce of finesse and impact that you can get on the very best versions (Gardiner, Bernstein/NYPO, Solti/LPO), but it beats out many recordings available at full price. Geoffrey Simon is excellent at colorful scores like this, and the LSO play predictably well. This is easily the best recording available at ""budget"" price - heads above the Naxos recording both in orchestral execution and recording quality.",1
"This is a REALLY good recording!: I bought this CD based on the recommendations of reviewers at Amazon and was not disappointed. I heard the Jupiter piece on my local classical station and in movie soundtracks and wanted to own it on CD but within a budget. This CD fits the bill. I am not a true classical afficianado (sp?), just an average person who happens to like a few classical pieces, so I admit that there may be recordings by other orchestras that are better and held up as the ""gold standard"" by true music lovers. But I think this one is very good and I highly recommend it as an affordable, well done orchestration of Holst's Planets.",1
The best music ever written. I mean EVER!!: Holst was an absolute genious. When he wrote this music it was a good day. Every song on this CD is a taste of heaven. THE BEST!!!,1
"VISIT THE STARS!!: We played ""Mars, the Bringer of War"" in band, and I was hooked. My favorites are Jupitor, Mars, and Uranus, in that order. Listen to them all!",1
"Low price, low quality: The Planets got me interested in classical music, and I've had the LA Philharmonic Orchestra version for a while. I had heard that the London Symphony Orchestra version was supposed to be the best, but then I got this version and quickly realized that I already had a better version. When listening to this version I kept thinking the musicians only showed up because they had to and that they were just waiting for the day to end. This version seems to lack motivation, and I think I'll avoid anything else by the London Symphony Orchestra because it will probably be boring. Overall, very disappointing.",0
"Frustrated and Annoyed: It has been a month since I ordered this product and I am yet to have it delivered. I am leery to try to puchase a copy elsewhere as I may end up with two copies. I have written to them, but they have not replied. I wonder if they are out of business?",0
"Lowbrow rendition of Holst: Skip this version. The price underscores the delivery - low price, low expectations. Mars, Bringer of War comes across like Boyscout, Bringer of Marshmallows. This wonderful work is defiled by conductor Simon. It sounds like it was recorded by the GW Bush middle-school band instead of the LSO. Sad.",0
math review: although i didn't buy this book yet i have read it. as an eager mathematics student i found it to be compelling. i totally loved it. i have never found a book that displays such an abundance of information without confusing the reader. i'm 15 and in calculus so it wasn't hard reading but i still wish i had it. i find times when it would have been very useful in remembering important topics connected to parametric and polar coordinates. i especially would find it useful for my small side learning of multivaraible calculus where it's information on spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems would be very helpful. throughout the book i was interested and i would recommend it to anyone who likes math,1
"Calypso Magic By Catherine Coulter: I loved this book but then I like all of Catherine Coulters' books. All three of the books in the Magic Trilogy were great. If you haven't read any of Catherine Coulters books, you are really missing out. I classify her as #2 and Nora Roberts as #1 of all women authors out there today.",1
"Calypso Magic: I have liked a number of Catherine Coulter's books for many years, but in this one she turns a good story into pornography! I was completely disgusted.",0
"An insult to intelligent women: From beginning to end nothing but a woman reduced by verbal and physical abuse, then finally rape. My apologies but this implausible herione continues to forgive him. I will never pick up another Catherine Coulter book for I am not a masochist.",0
"things didnt add up: the characters weren't consistent. The heroine starts out blunt and witty, willing to stand up for herself no matter what and by the end can't speak up to defend herself adequitely. Pretty cover, fun sparring of words, but inconsistent.",0
"Catherine spins a tale full of laughter and mystery,again!: I have been a great fan of Cathrine Coulter for a year now...My friend introduced her with a book given to me on my birthday...I just finished reading Calypso Magic,which is witty and full of intrigue...Lyon and Diana's constant arguements soon have them both enjoying and needing each other-stranded on an island is just the place for both of them to realize they both love each other...and,the evil on Savarol Island bring them closer.I haven't read the rest of The Magic Trilogy,but i am looking forward to it!",1
"Not Romantic: I couldn't even get half-way through this book. The characters are shallow and unreal, and the man is way too mean. It was ridiculous and unromantic, and I gave up not too far in and threw it in the trash where it belongs.",0
"No picture, no description either, just a part number?: I can see no reason to even list this, without a picture or even a description of it. You could steal it off the cruz tool website at least.How many pieces are there? What's it made of, how is it finished? What drive sizes are included? What socket sizes are included, if any? 6 point or 12 point sockets if any?",0
"Very diverse and well crafted work.: I first heard this album in a car, and so I didn't know who it was for a long time. But after I found out, I got this album because it had been very memorable. ""Frontier Psychiatrist"" and ""Avalanche Rock"" stick in my head the most, but I give just as much approval and recommmendation to all the other tracks on this album. It is a very well synthesized album and is definitely on the lines of original....",1
"Instant Favorite: If only I had short term memory loss and I could listen to this album over and over for the first time. They take pop music from the last few decades and make sense of it all. How? By cutting splinters of old albums and blending the samples into a well concocted cocktail called ""Since I Left You."" Listen for familiar samples or sit back and just enjoy it all for the first time--it works either way. It runs the gamut between disco to breaks, funk, pop, & lounge, all sitting in a martini glass made of kitsch. Comparable artists are Lemon Jelly & Timewriter, but Avalanches have their own twist, and perfected it on the first try.",1
"When Different Stops Being Good: I don't understand the huge praises of this album I have heard. It starts as though someone is entering a huge gathering of people where everyone seems to be least bothered about each other.These people are completely lost and have given themselves away to the moment. The only thing quite good about Avalanches is their ability in choosing a name for their band and an even better title for their album . The music lacks shape,direction and sounds nothing but monotonous. I have known a lot of music to grow on me but Avalanches refuses to budge from it's chaotic boredom. There is way too much good music in life than to sacrifice my time on Avalanches. I wish they tried not to make the album sound like a 50 min breather of coming back to life significance (much forced)Try some real music, get these albums -The Cure - Seventeen Seconds/DisintegrationCocteau Twins - Blue Bell Knoll/Heaven Or Las Vegas",0
"Looks like a stuff up: The CD displayed is not Yes Indeed by Ray Charles, which I would dearly love to have.",0
"flights of fantasy / underground fire: These albums by The Ventures are not only rare(Out of print), but probably the most unique...flights of fantasy was done with Nokie Edwards on lead guitar & Underground Fire with Gerry McGee on lead guitar.Both preceded the Super psychedelic album & Swamp Rock album which were two strange, yet awe striking .I would recommend this for the advid collector as well as the one first album of your collection...On The Flights of Fantasy, the tune with the same name is awesome and on the underground fire ""The Wild Angels"" is a step beyond The Ventures normal routines...I personally waited on this and the wait was worth it.Flights of Fantasy / Underground Fire",1
"Pleasant 60's style R&B..but not the real Platters!: If you like top 40 sounds that could be ""anygroup"", this is ok.....nothing to distinguish it from other groups. This is definitely not an album for people who want the smooth, emotional sound of the original Platters. Sonny Tuner does a creditable job as lead, but is definitely not a Tony Williams!!",0
"What a waste of talent: I could not believe that with such a great cast list I could be so totally bored! There is not a single rectifying statement I can make about this film. Oliver Reed, Michael York and John Mills - acting greats, all - are totally wasted in this venture into Cartland insipidity. The dialogue and ""action"" are filled with cliches, and there could not be a flatter relationship than that between Grant and Anthony - not one spark! Don't waste your time and money.",0
"Pretty to look at but not much else.: A romance set in 17th century England should be irresistable to me; especially one with such gorgeous costumes and scenery as this. However, this movie not only suffers from an insipid, silly storyline but from bad dialog as well. All you have to do is watch the very first scene of the movie for a shining example of truly awful dialog. I read Barbara Cartland novels when I was in my early to mid-teens and the story reminds me of some of the romantic tales my gal pal and I would cook up just for fun. Even so, I will give the movie two stars for its beautiful and mostly accurate costumes, especially the women's. It is also nice but rather surprising to see revered veteran actors like John Mills, Robert Morley and Gordon Jackson playing smaller roles in the movie.Unfortunately the video tape quality is awful and was almost unwatchable in the beginning. Luckily the tape was a gift and I didn't spend a dime on it!",0
"What a stinker!!!: I wasn't expecting high art when I bought this movie but I was at least expecting good acting considering the cast. This movie was so bad it was funny. I watched with a friend and we ended up making comments similar to those on Mystery Science Theater just to stay mildly entertained. The story was lame (to be expected) but the acting was lousy with the exception of Oliver Reed who was pretty good as the bad guy. All this on top of a truly hokey sound track. I have seen other movies in this genre, but YIKES this one takes the cake as the worst by far!",0
"Stand there and look pretty...: Probably watched this move 50x in my youth because it was one of my older sisters' favorites.""The Lady and the Highwayman"" is a great love story (thanks, Barbara Cartland*) but the acting of the girl (Lysette Anthony) is so bad! Typical Hugh Grant (+ long hair) and the villaneous Oliver Reed are both a delight. But the girl... My sisters and I now hold her acting in this movie as the perfect example of pretty, dumb blond who was told, ""stand there and look pretty.""Nevertheless if you have sarcastic taste in movies (as I do, 4 stars) it is a fun movie to watch especially for the early-years of High Grant.*If this is your first foray into Barbara Cartland land, I'd suggest ""A Hazard of Hearts"" (1987) with a young Helena Bonham Carter instead.",1
"Terrible!: Despite the fact that the cast includes Hugh Grant, this movie is a waste of time. Historical inaccuracy abounds - how many 17th century woman wore pounds of make-up and had such vividly died hair?",0
"not even worth buy from the discount bin: ...Alas, the print quality is terribly bad. It looks like it was made from a video tape that's been copied over and over and over - dark, fuzzy, flattened colors. So, I couldn't even appreciate the lovely costumes and settings.The story is so badly predictable and corny, the dialog is stilted, and the editing is terribly choppy. It's silly. It's boring. Not even a terrific cast (Hugh Grant, Oliver Reed, Michael York to name a few) could lift this one out of the doldrums.Pass on this one.",0
"If only I could give this movie an even lower rating...: The picture quality is HORRIBLE (and the sound is just as bad) Blurry, shaky, and the speed is off as well.The movie itself wasn't much better and Hugh Grant is barely recognizable. Save your money and let this one go by.",0
The Lady and the Highwayman: Story line was fair but the color was terrible and fuzzy. Wasn't worth watching or the price no matter how low the cost was.,0
"As seen on TV.: I bought this DVD b/c i had seen it on t.v before and just love old-fashioned romances esp.starring Hugh Grant. However, i didn't think the quality of pixels were that clear. Overall, still a good movie.",1
"Poorly reproduced, poorly directed: The copy of this I received, and I assume they are all alike, was very poor in video quality, not even as good as VHS. To add insult to injury, it seemed almost amateurish in direction and editing. While I realize that most films are shot scene by scene, usually clever editing and splicing makes a smoothly flowing final product. This actually looks like something high schoolers would have done with 8mm reels years ago. Hugh Grant is handsome, of course, and at least one of the female actors was very attractive, but looks alone can't save a film. Sorry to be so harsh, but I would say steer clear of this one.",0
"The quality of this DVD: I'm fond of movies set in older times and usually there is no problem with viewing them. This DVD however is a very bad one. I'm not reviewing the movie's plot, simply the condition of the DVD itself. The entire movie was quite blurry and in some of the scenes set in a cave, I was unable to see well enough to follow the action. Near the end of the movie strange tracking lines began running up the DVD and I've never seen that on any DVD before, only VHS tapes. Now I'm wondering if this was simply copied from someone's old badly taken care of VHS tape. I'm very disappointed because I had looked forward to seeing this movie. I really cannot recommend these DVDs to anyone.",0
old moviefan: don't buy this CD. The quality is terrible. Obviously the original film needs to be redone before they should even try to sell it which they did not do.,0
Bad: This movie is so bad that it's hilarious. Seriously. I thought at first it might be a spoof it was so silly. It's kinda hard to believe Hugh Grant still managed to have a great career after this!,0
"I Kept Falling Asleep: I am a Grant fan but I prefer his movies that were made latter in his career. This movie was made in the 80's based upon how young Grant looked. Next time I will do a better job in determining when the film was made prior to purchase. Otherwise I would not have rented the film. Therefore, my review of this film is not positive--as expected.Disappointing at best. I kept falling asleep, so maybe I missed some thrilling and defining moments. Regardless, character development was predictable, boring and silly.I do not recommend. Cheers!",0
"Well Done: I am not familiar with this conductor ""hartmut Haenchen"". But it is no matter. The entire rendering is beautiful, particularly the adagio. Having heard the 3rd by some great conductors, this one stands on it's own right. Very pleasurable.",1
"Pro's and con's of the Deluxe Edition Scrabble Game: I'm disappointed and delighted about my new Scrabble Deluxe game.The two things I am very disapointed at is the cheap plastic hinges that fold the game up breaks off after about the third time we opened it.Very cheesy and cheap.Also, the turntable for the game is not what we expected. We thought for $44. we should have at least had a turntable like a lazy Susan, but it rolls on casters which will mar a wooden table. I want my money back or a replacement, so now I will have to pursue that avenue. So, if cheap hinges, and no good turning board are your thing have at it.I am delighted with the size of the board and more letters and score points. Takes three hours of good old fashioned fun to finish.",0
"Disappointed: I bought this for my grandson because we love to play Scrabble and he wanted the rotating board with raised tile boxes. When we opened this we were surprised to see that it does NOT have a rotating base, it has some metal beads on the bottom that allow it to turn...if it is on a very smooth surface and even then it doesnt turn well. The board folds in the middle so the tiles down the middle don't sit well and the plastic board surface is not glued down properly. Also, Super Scrabble is a different game with double the amount of tiles to play and a much bigger board so that a game of Scrabble will take much, much longer to play.For $40 I expected better quality. We only kept it because I bought it online and didn't want to jump through the hoops of returning it via mail with shipping costs.",0
Great game but board poorly constructed: The plastic grid arrived in warped condition making tile placement difficult in the affected areas of the grid. While it still is playable the warped grid is distracting and disappointing.,0
"Great for the brain: The Super Scrabble Deluxe is my favorite game. And the customer service from Amazon was wonderful. I will be shopping with them again, and will tell my friends about the great service",1
"Awful version of a great game: I can't beleive how poorly designed this version is. The featherweight tiny plastic letters are too hard to pick up and manipulate. This is especially hard when trying to place them on the board in between those little plastic nibs at each corner of the board squares. The plastic letter holders are too lightweight and get knocked over easily. I'll also complain about the double amount of letters available. Sounds like a good idea, but in use it makes getting letters you need more rare... and getting too many of a particular vowel too often. The end result is a game that takes more than one night to finish. It's frustrating when playing with kids.",0
"Super Scrabble: This is simply the Cadillac of Scrabble games. If you play Scrabble, this is the only way to go!!!",1
"no information given about this product by amazon: This is not the scrabble game I was expecting.I bought it because of the raised grids, which it has. However it also has twice the number of spaces and letters. The board is much larger than the standard game.No such information was given by Amazon. I had to pay for return shipping which I did not appreciate. Be sure you understand what super deluxe means before you purchase this game.",0
"not the real scrabble: This was a mistake. I thought I was buying regular scrabble with the rotating board, which my daughter has always wanted. I have a set like this and she always comments about how nice it is when we play. When she opened it to play, she found it was some other version of the game and was very disappointed. Now she must go through the hassle of returning it by January 31 to get the delux real scrabble. I will never make a purchase like this online again.Claire Quaglieri",0
"LOVE it!: I love Scrabble! It's always been my favorite game. Well, this one takes Scrabble to a new level! It takes an already fun game, and makes it even more adicting! This is my new favorite game. I gave one to my adult daughter, and she loves it too. I highly recommend it!",1
"super scrabble deluxe: scrabble is scrabble, and more spaces, and more letters along with the quadruple scoring squares is just better. the only thing I was disappointed in was the way it rotates. there are ball bearings on the bottom, so it rolls rather than rotates. I was expecting a stand that rotated, like the older version of regular scrabble deluxe. but it is still a lot of fun",1
"Design, Craftmanship, & Challenge of Game: The design and craftmanship of this board is very poor. They use inexpensive plastic hinges on each end which causes ""warping"" of the thin plastic used. If they would 'spring' for two additional plastic hinges between each end it would greatly help in reducing the warping of the board. As it is I am expecting my third shipment in hopes of finally receiving ""one"" board that isn't warped and I can lay my letters flat. Upon picking up the board one has to be extremely careful as it tends to break apart at the hinges.Overall as a game it's terrific having more spaces and tiles to play with as it makes for a much more interesting and challenging game.",0
"Returning this today!: I was very disappointed with the Super Scrabble. I had hoped to find a Deluxe version that I had several years but this was the closest I could find. The description states it can be rotated around which I thought would be like the old deluxe version on a lazy susan. Not so. We had to slide this around on little ""ball baring"" feet which wasn't very helpful. Also, we began a game and wanted to continue it later. I went to pick up the board and it came apart at the middle seem where it was assembled. The only part that was okay are the plastic separators to help keep the tiles organized on the board. This was a gift for an elderly parent and it was frustrating for me! I am returning it today.",0
"Fragile Scrabble Game: This is a very cool Scrabble game. However, it arrived damaged, one of the little plastic hinges was broken upon arrival. It was a Fathers Day gift. We played it that evening and the tiles wouldn't sit flush because of the broken hinge. I have emailed the company twice with no response.",0
"super scrabble deluxe edition: I was very disappointed in the workmanship of this game. It was poorly made and it did not look like it would withstand years of playing. I owned this game in the past, but it was made by Milton Bradley. This particular game was made by the Hasbro Co. I think Milton Bradley game was of excellent quality. In the future, I will only buy games made by Milton Bradley.",0
"Very disappointed: For the amount of money paid for this game, we were very disappointed in how cheaply it was made. It is basically two pieces of plastic with cardboard sandwiched between them. The plastic is warped so much that the tile letters do not lay flat. The board folds in the middle and the two pieces do not even meet correctly, with one side raised higher than the other. As a result, all tiles placed on squares that run down the middle of the board, do not lay flat. There are several warped areas that lift up throughout the board that will pop if you press down on it, making the tiles pop up in the air.The concept is great. The product is not.",0
"GREAT GAME: It took me a couple of Scrabble games before I finally ""bit the bullet"" and paid the extra cost for this Super Scrabble Deluxe Edition.It is well worth the extra money. Not only are the tiles secured to the board, it slides with such ease on the table you hardly know it's moving.The only problem, if you want to fuss, is that the tiles are harder to put back into the box for storage since they are so secure in their raised squares. Oh well. It would be nice if someone would come up with a magnetic board and tiles game, but so far this doesn't exist.Any entrapreneurs out there?",1
"Super scrabble Deluxe: We love this game! More spaces, and more letters, and the extrs bonus squares make it lots more challenging and fun.Super Scrabble Deluxe Edition",1
"beware the board: WE love Scrabble. The Deluxe version is terrific, the one downside is the board. The seam in the middle lets the tiles wobble that are in the ""seam line"" and the little plastic hinges broke the second time we used the board. A very disappointing design flaw! Being creative, I have managed to effect a repair that has made the board sturdier, to bad the design team couldn't have done the same. I also made a platform for the game to sit on as the ballberrings can and will scratch whatever surface the game is placed on, another design flaw. Games can last longer and are more challenging with the extra space and letters. We truly enjoy it.",1
SUPER SCRABBLE DELUXE EDITION: IT BRINGS BACK THE FUN WE USED TO HAVE PLAYING THE GAME.ALL THE PIECES STAY IN PLACE WHENEVER THE GAME BOARD IS BUMPED,1
Scrabble game.: Ordered as new. Received as used. Should be better informed.. Price was different. Otherwise we are very happy with the game. Jack OB,1
SUPPER DUPPER: ;IT WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER IT WAS DELIVERED PROMPTLY AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED. i WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO SCRABBLE LOVERS WHO LIKE MORE CHALLENGE THAN THE ORIGINAL GAME.,1
not quality expected: Looked around for nice scrabble games with the interlocking tiles. Thought this one looked good and appeared to be high quality but when received it was cheap plastic tiles. Very disappointed.,0
"High price for poor quality: I have the Milton Bradley 50th Anniversary version of Scrabble and I like the quality of the game board and accessories. Thinking that this Hasbro version would be a new and interesting addition to the Scrabble line, I bought it as a gift for my friend. Unfortunately, when my friend opened it, I was embarrassed when I saw how cheap it looked. I paid way too much for a product of cheap quality. I'll stick with the Milton Bradley line in the future.",0
Super scrabble board not made well: I do like the expanded version. I am not happy with how poorly the board is constructed. I received it in a broken state. Plastic hinges are not strong enough to hold the boards weight. I had to glue and tape it together so it will not fall apart anymore. Pretty pricey for poor weak plastic design.,0
"Pleasurably Stretching Our Minds: Me Mum and I have been playing Scrabble daily for a long time but to now have a bigger board...more tiles and a board that sports raised plastic slots for the placement of each and every tile...well it almost feels a guilty pleasure indeed...Thanx and best wishes from...Kathryn Herriott Hunt...her Mum and what we feel is the requisate canine crowd ""cheering"" us on...",1
"disappointed avid scrabble payer: I play scrabble a few times a week with my wife and enjoy the challenges and creativity of it. We also enjoy the ""Upwards"" version of Scrabble. We decided to buy Super Scrabble and were very disappointed for many reasons. First the placement of the bonus squares weren't well planned. For example double word bonus squares are too close together so that one word can easily cover two of them. There are too many qualdruples scores leading to scores of over 700 for each player. The main drawback is that with 200 tiles it takes more than 3 hours to complete a game so we end up setting an end time which loses some of the challenges of using up all of the letters. Additionally some of the tiles have faded letters so the quality is poor and not in line with what is charged for the game. We've stopped playing it and will probably donate it to charity.",0
"More Interesting than Regular Scrabble!: The addition of so many extra tiles, plus the quadruple point score, made for a very exciting game. It takes longer than a typical regular Scrabble game, but the game holds our interest very well (so many possibilities!!). The raised board is wonderful, and it rotates very well. The only problem we encountered was when trying to put the game away...it's very hard to get the tiles back into the bag. They can't just slide in the way they would if the spaces weren't raised. But this is a minor flaw - the game itself is GREAT! Definitely recommended!",1
"Very good but larger than normal: Overall this is a very nice deluxe set. I was a bit surprised that the board has more spaces, and tiles than a standard Scrabble board. Games take longer and have more possibilities than normal but it is still the same Scrabble.",1
"Super Scrabble, not for the light hearted!!!: If you like scrabble you will LOVE Super Scrabble. More tiles and larger game board allows you to spell bigger words for bigger points! Please note however that the game takes twice as long because of the 200 letter tiles as opposed to the 100. The deluxe edition features a rotating board but it is not on a turntable. It is set with ball bearings allowing it to turn on a stable hard surface. Just don't set on anything you don't want to have scratched. Highly recommend.",1
"Poor quality board.: I gave this to my mother as a gift. After she took it on a trip to my sister's, they recommended I return it. The board folds in half, unlike the Deluxe Edition of the regular Scrabble game. The board is flimsy and didn't lay flat along the fold line, so the letters wouldn't lie flat. I was disappointed, to say the least. We love playing Scrabble, so my gripe is only about the board quality.",0
Super Scrabble: I played this game while visiting my Aunt and Uncle in FL and we had so much fun that I had to buy it when I got back to NY. The only problem I had was that the fold on the board doesn't allow the letters there to lay flat.,1
"Better than the original: Super Scrabble is what the original game wanted to be. With over 400 spaces (instead of the old 225), and quadruple scoring spaces, it's hours of fun! The deluxe game board has rollers on the bottom that make it easier to rotate the board, as long as you have a smooth table under it. The board is hinged in the center for storing, but be careful - the hinges are plastic and can come apart easily. The game board has a raised grid, eliminating the old problem of the letter tiles wandering off their spaces. Even if you've played the old game for years (which our family has), you'll want to play this one even more.",1
"Not happy with: For the price of this item roller balls are worthless, should have been on lazy susan style. Very shabbily made and must be very careful when opening and closing game. Would not recommend to anyone.",0
"Best game in a long time: I have a group of friends and we love playing Scrabble. I have all the types of scrabble (raised letter board, rotating board, but the new super scrabble with all the above features is the greatest. I love it so much I bought 3 for gifts. Its an evening of fun, for the whole family as well as friends. My grand kids also love to play.",1
"Super Deluxe Scrabble Edition: Very unhappy. Ordered this item specific to details. We received a super deluxe scRabble edition but not the one we ordered. Instead we got plastic letters not wood, a board with plastic nubs to keep letters in place rather than raised edges. It didn't rotate. I was so excited when I made the order and so disappointed when it was delivered. I don't have the time or energy to do all that is required to return it! It makes me Leary of ever ordering anything again online.",0
"great gift for my son's new friend in Korea.: The board turns 360 degrees and rolls smoothly, which makes it easy to look at the words right side up without moving around.",1
"Poor Quality: although scoring is crazy high, you would think for the price they would have made it on a turntable and with wood, not cheap plastic- hence DELUXE it is not",0
scrabble board complaint: The concept is great but the design is terrible. Two of our hinged boards have broken at the hinge with very gentle use. The larger board should be redesigned like the Milton Bradley Deluxe Edition with grid and turntable - a much better design.,0
Not what I was looking for: Was not what I expected. I was wanting the regular Scrabble gamewithout all the extras. Order a different one later,0
"Super Scrabble Deluxe Edition: I hadn't played Scrabble for years but a friend wanted to play. So, ahead of time I bought this and I'm really glad I did. We had a blast on it, although I kept losing, and I would reccomend this game to my friends & family too. Buy it! It really is a lifetime investment!",1
Poor quality: Poorly and cheaply made. Board comes apart at hinges with little effort. Not at all what we expected! Miss our old board terribly!,0
"scrabble can't miss: Scrabble has always been a great educational game. The first Super scrabble board I had was like the old boards, with tiles that could be bumped out of place. This board solves that problem. My only knock is that the board will not turn easily unless you're on a totally flat surface. But hey, what's perfect?",1
Super Scrabble: we've been playing Scrabble for years and actually wore out the Super Scrabble we had. This one is so well made I expect it to last a life time.,1
not so good: This game is not very good board was connected in middle with hinges and was not even. the middle row of letters tilted. Would rather have a board in one piece.,0
Terrific Series: I love Midsomer Murders. When I could no longer get it on TV I began ordering them in DVD format and I love them! It's wonderful to be able to watch them whenever I please. This seller is great. Good customer service and prompt mailing. High recommendation for both the movie and seller.,1
"Smells like The Green Tree: It smells like the green tree, over-powering, no jasmine scent. I had it in my car for 15 minutes and threw it away. It took a week for the smell to go away. Yuck",0
Great Product!: I've been looking for a high quality belt to wear at work. This is it! The materials are of the best quality and the workmanship is beyond compare.I haven't seen such a fine quality leather product for many years.,1
"A rich cultural twist to old holiday favorites.: This CD was a great treat! Old holiday favorites that were hit with a Cajun fiddle and a whole new soule. My personal favorite is the first cut, Up on the Roof Top, which contains some verses in French. Hadley Castille and the Lousiana Cajun Band put a lot of heart into their music that you can't miss when you listen to it.I have been blessed with the opportunity to see them live twice. What a treat! Hadley gives little tid-bits about Lousiana history with that southern charm that he's famous for. History has never sounded so good. They are a great bunch of guys who love to make great music so sit back and enjoy.",1
"15 years later, still no proof: This book was written because the author claims that she instantly healed herself of cancer. (yes, I'm serious) 15 years after the magical moment, it has been discovered that she never had cancer, which makes it impossible to heal. This, and her other books, have mislead people into believe that the ""product"" works- which is her technique that she claims she channeled from God. There is no proof that this whole ""DNA Activation"" thing works AT ALL, but it's claimed to make people younger. So, why is the author aging? And why are people still dying of cancer (and other ailments).This books is worthless. No, wait. You can use a page of it if you have a wad of gum to throw away and lost the wrapper.",0
"New Age, Ungodly Drivel: If there are any books that should be burned, this is one of them. Don't waste your money on such ... garbage. The god that Stibal talks about is certainly not the real One, that's for sure.",0
"Amazing healing works!: I have had the privilege to study with Vianna after reading her books, (which I highly recommend to anyone serious about this work) and have been practicing the techniques outlined in the book for one year now. The transformations they have enabled in my life and that of others are nothing short of a miracle. I feel truly blessed to have crossed path with Vianna.Beliefs and behavior patterns can be easily transformed energetically instantly, which saves you years compared to other methods.Physical healing that defies conventional medicine views are easily achievable.The key to excel with the tools outlined in these books is to do belief work on yourself without fail. The more of a clear channel you are, the more efficient you will be as a healer.I offer myself as a support in this amazing journey. Email me any questions at info@Beyond-Beliefs.comWith all my loveTamara",1
A Fantastic Book: I could not put this book down once I began reading it. Vianna Stobal's own life healing experiences along with her instruction on teaching others to heal is amazing. I believe she has found the key to making us all healthier people capable of healing ourselves and others.,1
Very good job!: This dvd shows the wildlife in Africa's Rift Valley. I found it very informative and entertaining. The videography is fantastic. This dvd is a nice one to watch over and over again.,1
"Exceedingly poor quality: Seriously shoddy quality, back board is really flimsy and doesn't even attach to the the piece you sit on. Parts not manufactured well, pieces arrived scratched, some parts don't even fit.",0
"Winsome = poor quality: Poor quality, poor fit, poor design, cheap hardware, don't buy. Screws stripped, took me 8 deck screw to tighten up joints!!",0
"Way over priced.: Hog Wild Fridge Pins are way over priced and a few had the magnets have fallen out of the plastic. This was very disappointing, I had waited a long time to buy these. Strangely enough I found cheaper ones at Kmart with larger and stronger magnets. For the price of $1.49 you can get an 8 pack at Kmart.",0
"I love these magnets!: These magnets are awesome. I'm sick of weak magnets on my fridge that are constantly falling off when the door is opened, or unable to hold anything more than a piece of paper. These magnets are strong, sturdy, small enough to not cover up whatever it's holding, easy to position, and even look cool. I've got one holding up a fabric patch on my fridge even. I don't want any other magnets other than these on my fridge. They are a little pricey for magnets, but worth every penny!",1
"it needs silence all right.: I didnt like anything about this flick.Title has Bangkok so I kinda expect to see city once in a while--no luck. The impression from movie is people are killed left and right in Thailand when in reality it very safe, peaceful and plenty of fun not counting culture in different forms waiting on each corner.The problem is crime rate in USA about 10 times higher than in Thailand but movie gives me opposite impression. Give me facts and entertainment.",0
"The Thai that binds...sorry.: Bangko Dangerous played a little too much like Kar Wai's Fallen Angels(deaf/mute hitman with somewhat arrested developement, similar music video like cinematography, etc) but was enjoyable none the less.A deaf hitman goes about killing for pay, but stumbles on to a young girl(Premsinee Ratanasophacan) who sees past his handicap and the two fall for each other. Then he takes work home with him, showing the young girl his violent side(aimed at some confronting punks, not her) and coupled with the death of his friend and coworker, his seemingly intact world starts to fall apart.I won't go on any further and spoil the film for you, but none of it's unexpected or totally new. Still, I don't regret watching the film and wouldn't mind purchasing the DVD simply because, when viewed just as a fim and not some new hope or whatever, it's a good movie.Definately worth a rent and if you love movies like Leon, Ghost Dog or Fallen Angels, you might want to pick this one up.",1
"Powdered vanilla?: I was a little hesitant to buy this. Glad I did; I love this vanilla product. From hot cereal and smoothies, to coffee and tea and hot chocolate, to baked goods and fresh fruit ... well, just about anything that could benefit from a little sweet richness without any alcohol. Now I keep a jar of it right next to the salt and pepper, I use it so often. It isn't fresh vanilla bean, but a close second. And it doesn't drip! :)",1
"Pure GMO (genetically modified organism) Vanilla Powder: I bought this vanilla powder in Whole Foods, I assumed that Whole Foods sell best products. Unfortunately WH also sell GMO, but they pay me money back even for empty bottles of this vanilla powder.I do not recommend to buy this vanilla powder, especially for children and young adults, because maltodextrin is made from GMO (genetically modified organism).Nielsen-Massey company also give me false info over the phone that they do not use GMO.Here is part of document I received from Nielsen-Massey company by email:""To whom it might concern:Regarding MALTRIN M100 and M510 maltodextrin, these products are processed from some GMO raw materials. These products will typically test negative for GMOs by PCR method. Those products will not meet EU labeling regulations as a non-GMO....""",0
"""Pure"" vanilla powder??: I was disappointed that this product was not as advertised. It may be pure vanilla powder but it is mixed with a lot of sugar (dextrose). The advertising on the side says it is 'sugar-free' but the ingredients list dextrose or something similar. The ingredient list was covered by a sticky label so it was hard to see what the actual ingredients were.They need to change their product or their advertising. They don't match. Otherwise, I like the taste and the fragrance of this product. Just don't want to pay a high price for something that is part sugar.",0
"two strikes you're out: This is the second of these type watches I've purchased in 6 weeks. The first lost the top of the watch in 3 1/2 weeks. I tried again with this purchase, and after 3 days the watch band broke.I think the Nike product is just put together poorly, and is no reflection on the vender, who saved me more than 1/2 price from the retail price.",0
"Another great book: This is another fine book by L'Amour. Like all his great western novels, the good guy wind the battle and rises off into the sunset. I love it!!!!",1
"Great total body work-out!: Patrick Goudeau is an excellent and motivating trainer with lots of positive energy. I like to use this dvd for days when I want a moderate, not strenuous, work-out. Worth the purchase!",1
"Leo Laporte for president: I read the book from cover to cover. I have all of Leo Laporte's books, listen to his podcast This Week in Tech (TWiT), and watch his cable TV show.",1
"Mel bay 100 tunes: This book has 100 songs but I have never heard of one of them. The songs are all less than one page long, and they are difficult to play. If you are a beginner or intermediate player this book is not for you. If you want to sing along forget it.",0
"Only Ever you - Backspaced: Great dance music, full of energy, great lyrics.Sounds like midnight oil, only better.Buy this album, support NZ music.This is good stuff.",1
"Need to Have: This book was in geat condition. Better than I thought it would be. This is a book, I will use time and time again. There was good information here, which can be used at anytime.",1
"Gang busters: Greetings,This film is a fantastic journey thru the lives of some very significant folks in our Los Angeles metroplex.This film is for real, really for real, and I am blessed to have it on my shelf.One Love revtombrown",1
"good shoe: I have had these shoes for 2 months, not a problem noted, seamless design, to spots for irritation, and I have not had any problems with sqeaking.",1
"Nike Presto: Love the watch, (this is my third, lost the first one) This is my everyday watch. It has all the features you need (Time, Date, Stop Watch , Backlight, Durable and Stylish.",1
"A book for Boeing fans: Excellent photography, interesting text, this book has it all. From the 717 to 777, it gives you a good idea about Boeing's latest products. As a Boeing pilot, I recommend it!",1
"Tragic Symphony: When Brahms wrote one of greatest of all symphonies (his 4th), surely he never envisioned that the heart and soul would one day be ripped from it by hackneyed amateur orchestras. Just how can so-called ""professional"" musicians do this monumental injustice to such magnificent music?On this DELTA brand CD, the name of the last selection, the ""Tragic"" Overture, sums up precisely the four symphonic movements that precede it. You are unlikely to encounter a more lifeless performance of Brahms' fourth anywhere-- the Netherlands Philharmonic sounds as wooden as a Dutchman's shoes. Zero stars!",0
"If you love The Ventures: I had this vinyl album (The Fabulous Ventures) and really, really missed it. Great stuff here. Can't beat their version of the Pink Panther theme. The second Ventures album included is mostly crap, but I am happy with my purchase.",1
"Sophmore Slump? I think not!: I stole this Cd from my cousin because I loved Case of the Ex and Best of Me. When I listened Mya took my interest with her up tempo numbers and dreamy ballads. While her voice isn't top notch it doesn't matter. Only Pussycats to me is a miss step.Mya actually channels a little soul on Man in my life (Toni Braxton like someone else said). However a highlight is I can't believe a slow tune about how Mya can't beleive her man is in love with another and not her. A lot of people can relate to that! Should have been a single.Favorites: Best of me, Case of the ex, Man in my life, and I can't believe.",1
